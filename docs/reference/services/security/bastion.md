## Overview

This service creates a single EC2 instance that is meant to serve as a [bastion host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host).

![Bastion architecture](/img/reference/services/security/bastion-architecture.png)

A bastion host is a security practice where it is the **only** server exposed to the public. You must connect to it
before you can connect to any of the other servers on your network. This way, you minimize the surface area you expose
to attackers, and can focus all your efforts on locking down just a single server.

## Features

*   Build an AMI to run on the bastion host
*   Create EC2 instance for the host
*   Allocate an Elastic IP Address (EIP) and an associated DNS record
*   Create an IAM Role and IAM instance profile
*   Create a security group allowing access to the host
*   Harden the OS by installing `fail2ban`, `ntp`, `auto-update`, `ip-lockdown`, and more
*   Send all logs and metrics to CloudWatch
*   Configure alerts in CloudWatch for CPU, memory, and disk space usage
*   Manage SSH access with IAM groups using `ssh-grunt`

:::note

This repo is a part of the [Gruntwork Service Catalog](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/),
a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code.
If you’ve never used the Service Catalog before, make sure to read
[How to use the Gruntwork Service Catalog](https://docs.gruntwork.io/reference/services/intro/overview)!

### Core concepts

To understand core concepts like why you should use a bastion host, how to connect to the bastion host, how to use the
bastion host as a "jump host" to connect to other instances, port forwarding, and more, see the
[bastion-host documentation](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-server/tree/master/examples/bastion-host)
documentation in the [terraform-aws-server](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-server) repo.

### The bastion host AMI

The bastion host AMI is defined using the [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) templates `bastion-host-ubuntu.json` (Packer
< v1.7.0) and `bastion-host-ubuntu.pkr.hcl` (Packer >= v1.7.0). The template configures the AMI to:

*   Run the [ssh-grunt module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/tree/master/modules/ssh-grunt) so
    that developers can upload their public SSH keys to IAM and use those SSH keys, along with their IAM user names, to
    SSH to the bastion host.

*   Run the [auto-update module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/tree/master/modules/auto-update)
    so that the bastion host installs security updates automatically.

*   Optionally run the
    [syslog module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/master/modules/logs/syslog) to
    automatically rotate and rate limit syslog so that the bastion host doesn’t run out of disk space from large volumes
    of logs.

## Deploy

### Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

*   [examples/for-learning-and-testing folder](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/master/examples/for-learning-and-testing): The
    `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
    testing (but not direct production usage).

### Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

*   [examples/for-production folder](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/master/examples/for-production): The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample code
    optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
    [Gruntwork Reference Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture), and it shows you how we build an
    end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog, configure CI / CD for your apps and
    infrastructure.
