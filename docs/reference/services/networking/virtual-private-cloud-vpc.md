        <td>If true, will apply the default NACL rules in var.default_nacl_ingress_rules and var.default_nacl_egress_rules to the public, private, and persistence subnets created by this module. Note that every VPC has default NACL rules that apply to subnets. When this is false, the original default NACL rules managed by AWS will be used. If you are managing NACLs for the subnets using another module or for some reason do not want to use the default NACLs, set this to false.</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>availability_zone_exclude_names</td>

    </tr><tr>
        <td>create_dns_forwarder</td>
        <td>Whether or not to create DNS forwarders from the Mgmt VPC to the App VPC to resolve private Route 53 endpoints. This is most useful when you want to keep your EKS Kubernetes API endpoint private to the VPC, but want to access it from the Mgmt VPC (where your VPN/Bastion servers are).</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>create_flow_logs</td>
        <td>If you set this variable to false, this module will not create VPC Flow Logs resources. This is used as a workaround because Terraform does not allow you to use the 'count' parameter on modules. By using this parameter, you can optionally create or not create the resources within this module.</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>create_network_acls</td>
        <td>If set to false, this module will NOT create Network ACLs. This is useful if you don't want to use Network ACLs or you want to provide your own Network ACLs outside of this module.</td>

    </tr><tr>
        <td>create_public_subnets</td>
        <td>If set to false, this module will NOT create the public subnet tier. This is useful for VPCs that only need private subnets. Note that setting this to false also means the module will NOT create an Internet Gateway or the NAT gateways, so if you want any public Internet access in the VPC (even outbound accessâ€”e.g., to run apt get), you'll need to provide it yourself via some other mechanism (e.g., via VPC peering, a Transit Gateway, Direct Connect, etc).</td>

The value for this variable must be a map where the keys are a unique name for each rule and the values are objects with the same fields as the egress block in the aws_default_network_acl resource: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/default_network_acl.</td>

        <td>How many AWS Availability Zones (AZs) to use. One subnet of each type (public, private app) will be created in each AZ. Note that this must be less than or equal to the total number of AZs in a region. A value of null means all AZs should be used. For example, if you specify 3 in a region with 5 AZs, subnets will be created in just 3 AZs instead of all 5. Defaults to all AZs in a region.</td>
