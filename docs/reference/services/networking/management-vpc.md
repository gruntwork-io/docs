# Management VPC

## Overview

This service contains code to deploy a [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) on AWS that can be
used for administrative and management purposes, such as CI/CD services. The primary difference between this and the
[application VPC](/reference/services/networking/virtual-private-cloud-vpc) is this one has two subnet tiers (public and private) while the application VPC has three
(public, private, and persistence). In this management VPC, we assume that there are no data stores that need to be
separated in to a dedicated persistence tier.

![VPC architecture](/img/reference/services/networking/vpc-architecture.png)

## Features

*   The VPC itself.
*   Subnets, which are isolated subdivisions within the VPC. There are 2 "tiers" of subnets, public and private, spanning
    multiple availability zones.
*   Route tables, which provide routing rules for the subnets.
*   Internet Gateways to route traffic to the public Internet from public subnets.
*   NATs to route traffic to the public Internet from private subnets.

## Learn

:::note

This repo is a part of the [Gruntwork Service Catalog](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/),
a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code.
If you’ve never used the Service Catalog before, make sure to read
[How to use the Gruntwork Service Catalog](https://docs.gruntwork.io/reference/services/intro/overview)!

:::

Under the hood, this is all implemented using Terraform modules from the Gruntwork
[terraform-aws-vpc](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc) repo. If you are a subscriber and don’t have
access to this repo, email <support@gruntwork.io>.

### Core concepts

To understand core concepts like what’s a VPC, how subnets are configured, how network ACLs work, and more, see the
documentation in the [terraform-aws-vpc](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc) repo.

### Repo organization

*   [modules](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/v0.107.3/modules): The main implementation code for this repo, broken down into multiple standalone, orthogonal submodules.
*   [examples](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/v0.107.3/examples): This folder contains working examples of how to use the submodules.
*   [test](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/v0.107.3/test): Automated tests for the modules and examples.

## Deploy

### Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

*   [examples/for-learning-and-testing folder](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/v0.107.3/examples/for-learning-and-testing): The
    `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
    testing (but not direct production usage).

### Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

*   [examples/for-production folder](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/v0.107.3/examples/for-production): The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample code
    optimized or direct usage in production. This is code from the
    [Gruntwork Reference Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture), and it shows you how we build an
    end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog.
