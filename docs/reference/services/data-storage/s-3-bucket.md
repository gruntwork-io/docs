## Overview

This service contains code to deploy an [S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) on AWS.

![S3 bucket architecture](/img/reference/services/data-storage/s3-bucket-architecture.png)

## Features

*   Deploy a private, secure S3 bucket
*   Configure access logging to another S3 bucket
*   Configure object versioning
*   Configure cross-region replication

## Learn

:::note

This repo is a part of the [Gruntwork Service Catalog](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/),
a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code.
If you’ve never used the Service Catalog before, make sure to read
[How to use the Gruntwork Service Catalog](https://docs.gruntwork.io/reference/services/intro/overview)!

:::

*   [Gruntwork private-s3-bucket module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/tree/master/modules/private-s3-bucket): The underlying module that implements the private S3 bucket functionality.

*   [S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/GetStartedWithS3.html): Amazon’s docs for S3 that
    cover core concepts such as creating, accessing, copying and deleting buckets.

## Deploy

### Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

*   [examples/for-learning-and-testing folder](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/v0.104.6/examples/for-learning-and-testing): The
    `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
    testing (but not direct production usage).

### Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

*   [examples/for-production folder](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/v0.104.6/examples/for-production): The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample code
    optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
    [Gruntwork Reference Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/), and it shows you how we build an
    end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog.

*   [How to enable MFA Delete?](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/tree/master/modules/private-s3-bucket#how-do-you-enable-mfa-delete): step-by-step guide on enabling MFA delete for your S3 buckets.

   Ideally, this would be a map(object({...})), but the Terraform object type constraint doesn't support optional
   parameters, whereas IAM policy statements have many optional params. And we can't even use map(any), as the
   Terraform map type constraint requires all values to have the same type ("shape"), but as each object in the map
   may specify different optional params, this won't work either. So, sadly, we are forced to fall back to "any."

   Ideally, this would be a map(object({...})), but the Terraform object type constraint doesn't support optional

   Terraform map type constraint requires all values to have the same type ("shape"), but as each object in the map
   may specify different optional params, this won't work either. So, sadly, we are forced to fall back to "any."
