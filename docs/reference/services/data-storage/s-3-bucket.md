<a name="access_logging_bucket" className="snap-top"></a>

* [**`access_logging_bucket`**](#access_logging_bucket) &mdash; The S3 bucket where access logs for this bucket should be stored. Set to null to disable access logging.

<a name="access_logging_bucket_lifecycle_rules" className="snap-top"></a>

* [**`access_logging_bucket_lifecycle_rules`**](#access_logging_bucket_lifecycle_rules) &mdash; The lifecycle rules for the access logs bucket. See [`lifecycle_rules`](#lifecycle_rules) for details.

<a name="access_logging_bucket_ownership" className="snap-top"></a>

* [**`access_logging_bucket_ownership`**](#access_logging_bucket_ownership) &mdash; Configure who will be the default owner of objects uploaded to the access logs S3 bucket: must be one of BucketOwnerPreferred (the bucket owner owns objects), ObjectWriter (the writer of each object owns that object), or null (don't configure this feature). Note that this setting only takes effect if the object is uploaded with the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/about-object-ownership.html for more info.

<a name="access_logging_bucket_policy_statements" className="snap-top"></a>

* [**`access_logging_bucket_policy_statements`**](#access_logging_bucket_policy_statements) &mdash; The IAM policy to apply to the S3 bucket used to store access logs. You can use this to grant read/write access. This should be a map, where each key is a unique statement ID (SID), and each value is an object that contains the parameters defined in the comment above.

<a name="access_logging_prefix" className="snap-top"></a>

* [**`access_logging_prefix`**](#access_logging_prefix) &mdash; A prefix (i.e., folder path) to use for all access logs stored in [`access_logging_bucket`](#access_logging_bucket). Only used if [`access_logging_bucket`](#access_logging_bucket) is specified.

<a name="bucket_kms_key_arn" className="snap-top"></a>

* [**`bucket_kms_key_arn`**](#bucket_kms_key_arn) &mdash; Optional KMS key to use for encrypting data in the S3 bucket. If null, data in S3 will be encrypted using the default aws/s3 key. If provided, the key policy of the provided key must allow whoever is writing to this bucket to use that key.

<a name="bucket_ownership" className="snap-top"></a>

* [**`bucket_ownership`**](#bucket_ownership) &mdash; Configure who will be the default owner of objects uploaded to this S3 bucket: must be one of BucketOwnerPreferred (the bucket owner owns objects), ObjectWriter (the writer of each object owns that object), or null (don't configure this feature).

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/about-object-ownership.html for more info.

<a name="bucket_policy_statements" className="snap-top"></a>

<a name="bucket_sse_algorithm" className="snap-top"></a>

* [**`bucket_sse_algorithm`**](#bucket_sse_algorithm) &mdash; The server-side encryption algorithm to use on the bucket. Valid values are AES256 and aws:kms. To disable server-side encryption, set [`enable_sse`](#enable_sse) to false.

<a name="enable_versioning" className="snap-top"></a>

* [**`enable_versioning`**](#enable_versioning) &mdash; Set to true to enable versioning for this bucket. If enabled, instead of overriding objects, the S3 bucket will always create a new version of each object, so all the old values are retained.

<a name="force_destroy_logs" className="snap-top"></a>

* [**`force_destroy_logs`**](#force_destroy_logs) &mdash; If set to true, when you run 'terraform destroy', delete all objects from the logs bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error.

<a name="lifecycle_rules" className="snap-top"></a>

* [**`lifecycle_rules`**](#lifecycle_rules) &mdash; The lifecycle rules for this S3 bucket. These can be used to change storage types or delete objects based on customizable rules.

<a name="mfa_delete" className="snap-top"></a>

* [**`mfa_delete`**](#mfa_delete) &mdash; Enable MFA delete for either 'Change the versioning state of your bucket' or 'Permanently delete an object version'. This cannot be used to toggle this setting but is available to allow managed buckets to reflect the state in AWS. Only used if [`enable_versioning`](#enable_versioning) is true. For instructions on how to enable MFA Delete, check out the README from the terraform-aws-security/private-s3-bucket module.
