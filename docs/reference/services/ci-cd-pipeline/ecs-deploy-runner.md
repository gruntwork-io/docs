## Overview

This service deploys ECS Deploy Runner, the central component of [Gruntwork Pipelines](https://gruntwork.io/pipelines).

![Gruntwork Pipelines architecture](/img/reference/services/ci-cd-pipeline/pipelines-architecture.png)

Gruntwork Pipelines is a code framework and approach that enables you to use your preferred CI tool to set up an
end-to-end pipeline for infrastructure code (Terraform) and app code packaged in multiple formats, including container
images (Docker) and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs built with Packer).

## Features

*   Set up a Terraform and Terragrunt pipeline based on best practices
*   Run deployments using Fargate or EC2 tasks on the ECS cluster
*   Configure the pipeline for building Packer and Docker images and for running `plan` and `apply` operations
*   Grant fine-grained permissions for running deployments with minimum necessary privileges
*   Stream output from the pipeline to CloudWatch Logs
*   Protect secrets needed by the pipeline using AWS Secrets Manager
*   Use KMS grants to allow the ECS task containers to access shared secrets and encrypted images between accounts
*   Easily upgrade Terraform versions with Terraform version management support

Under the hood, this is all implemented using Terraform modules from the Gruntwork
[terraform-aws-ci](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci) repo.

## Learn

:::note

This repo is a part of the [Gruntwork Service Catalog](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/),
a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code.
If youâ€™ve never used the Service Catalog before, make sure to read
[How to use the Gruntwork Service Catalog](https://docs.gruntwork.io/reference/services/intro/overview)!

:::

### Core concepts

*   For a comprehensive guide to Gruntwork Pipelines, refer to
    [How to configure a production-grade CI-CD workflow for infrastructure code](https://docs.gruntwork.io/guides/build-it-yourself/pipelines/).
*   For an overview of how the various parts fit together to form the complete pipeline, refer to the
    [ECS Deploy Runner Core Concepts](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci/blob/master/modules/ecs-deploy-runner/core-concepts.md#overview).
*   The rest of the docs within the
    [ecs-deploy-runner module in the terraform-aws-ci repository](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci/blob/master/modules/ecs-deploy-runner/README.adoc)
    may also help with context.
*   The [ECS Deploy Runner standard configuration](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci/blob/master/modules/ecs-deploy-runner-standard-configuration/README.md)
    is a shortcut for setting up the `ecs-deploy-runner` module in a manner consistent with Gruntwork recommendations.

## Deploy

### Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

*   [examples/for-learning-and-testing folder](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/v0.105.0/examples/for-learning-and-testing): The
    `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
    testing (but not direct production usage).

### Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

*   [shared account ecs-deploy-runner configuration in the for-production folder](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/v0.105.0/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/shared/us-west-2/mgmt/ecs-deploy-runner/):
    The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample code optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from
    the [Gruntwork Reference Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/), and it shows you how we build an
    end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog.

   We expect the following attributes on this object:
   - ami [string] (REQUIRED) : The ID of an AMI to use when deploying the instance. Either ami or ami_filters must be
                               provided.
   - ami_filters [AMIFilter] (REQUIRED) : Properties on the AMI that can be used to lookup a prevuild AMI for use with

   - min_size [number] (default: 1) : The minimum number of EC2 Instances launchable for this ECS Cluster. Useful for
                                      auto-scaling limits.

                                                  recommend using at least large class instances.
