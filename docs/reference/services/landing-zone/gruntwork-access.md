## Overview

You can use this service to grant the Gruntwork team access to your AWS account to either:

*   Deploying a [Reference Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/)
*   Helping your team with troubleshooting.

Under the hood, this service creates an [IAM Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) in
your AWS account that the Gruntwork team can assume. This allows the Gruntwork team to securely access your AWS accounts
without having to create, share, or manage credentials.

## Features

*   Create an IAM role that grants Gruntwork access to your AWS accounts
*   Choose the Managed IAM Policy to grant
*   Require MFA for assuming the IAM role
*   Grant access to your own security account (required for Reference Architecture deployments)

## Learn

:::note

This repo is a part of the [Gruntwork Service Catalog](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/),
a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code.
If youâ€™ve never used the Service Catalog before, make sure to read
[How to use the Gruntwork Service Catalog](https://docs.gruntwork.io/reference/services/intro/overview)!

### Core concepts

*   [What is the Gruntwork Reference Architecture?](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/)

## Deploy

### Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

*   [examples/for-learning-and-testing folder](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/master/examples/for-learning-and-testing): The
    `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
    testing (but not direct production usage).

### Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

*   [examples/for-production folder](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/master/examples/for-production): The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample code
    optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
    [Gruntwork Reference Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/), and it shows you how we build an
    end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog, configure CI / CD for your apps and
    infrastructure.
