This OpenTofu/Terraform module provisions multiple AWS accounts using AWS Control Tower Account Factory. Under the hood, it leverages the [control-tower-account-factory-async](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-control-tower/tree/v1.0.2/modules/control-tower-account-factory-async) module for account creation. It also includes a separate mechanism to detect and remediate drifted or outdated AWS Service Catalog products asynchronously, outside of OpenTofu/Terraform, using an EventBridge rule, SQS, Lambda, and AWS Step Functions.

## Background and Justification

The standard synchronous approach to provisioning or updating AWS accounts via Control Tower can lead to lengthy OpenTofu/Terraform runs, especially when Control Tower APIs are slow or when updating a large number of accounts. More importantly, certain types of "drift" caused by Control Tower changes are difficult to reconcile using OpenTofu/Terraform alone.

This module takes an asynchronous approach by deploying infrastructure (EventBridge, SQS, Lambda, and AWS Step Functions) that monitors for certain API calls. When relevant API calls are made (`UpdateProvisioningArtifact` and `UpgradeProduct`), the Lambda is triggered to complete the update process independently of OpenTofu/Terraform.

This leads to:

*   Faster OpenTofu/Terraform applies
*   More scalable update workflows
*   Improved handling of state drift

## Why remediate provisioned_product_id drift?

In AWS Control Tower, certain changes made via the AWS Console or APIs result in drift from the OpenTofu/Terraform state. For example:

*   Moving an account to a new Organizational Unit (OU)
*   Updating the Account Factory product version
*   Modifying Service Catalog configurations

These actions change the `provisioned_product_id`, which causes OpenTofu/Terraform to report drift. Left unresolved, this will make your infrastructure state inconsistent. Since the AWS Provider drives all changes to your Service Catalog provisioned products via updates to the `provisioned_product_id`, the value needs to be up to date to continue making changes to it.

By queuing and applying these updates asynchronously:

*   The drift is remediated safely and automatically
*   The Control Tower changes are reflected in your environment
*   You avoid the overhead and risk of long-running OpenTofu/Terraform changes

## How It Works

*   EventBridge Rule: Listens via CloudTrail for UpdateProvisioningArtifact or UpgradeProduct API calls.
*   Ingest Lambda: Triggered by the EventBridge rule, it finds all provisioned products that need an update and queues them in an SQS FIFO queue. This ensures order and prevents race conditions.
*   SQS Queue: Serves as a reliable, asynchronous work queue. It is configured as a FIFO queue with content-based deduplication and a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ).
*   Worker Lambda: Triggered by messages from the SQS queue, it applies the necessary provisioned_product_id updates by calling UpdateProvisionedProduct. It then initiates an AWS Step Functions state machine to track the update.
*   AWS Step Functions state machine: Periodically checks the status of the Service Catalog update record to verify that it has succeeded or failed, ensuring the update is fully completed.

### Controlling Concurrency

AWS Service Catalog currently enforces a [hard limit of 5 account-related operations concurrently](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/provision-and-manage-accounts.html#:~:text=You%20can%20perform%20up%20to%20five%20\(5\)%20account%2Drelated%20operations%20concurrently%2C%20including%20provisioning%2C%20updating%2C%20and%20enrolling.) that includes provisioning, updating, and enrolling. Exceeding this limit may result in throttling errors or failed updates.

To respect this limitation and offer flexibility, this module provides a configurable variable `lambda_worker_max_concurrent_operations` that governs how many updates will be performed in parallel. While the upper limit is 5 (per AWS constraints), setting it lower may be preferred in environments where other Service Catalog actions must occur concurrently (such as provisioning new accounts). This ensures that background remediation work does not block critical operations or trigger rate limiting.
