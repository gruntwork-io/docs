# Control Tower Account Factory

This is a Terraform module that will trigger the creation of a new AWS account by using Control Tower.

Under the hood, this module uses AWS Service Catalog to trigger Control Tower, as Control Tower does not currently
expose any APIs to trigger it directly.

## Control Tower Service Catalog YAML

The below YAML is copied from the Control Tower product in AWS Service Catalog. It is useful in knowing what
parameters to pass to this Service Catalog product:

*Note: some of the data below (e.g., the `AllowedValues` for `ManagedOrganizationalUnit`) is auto-generated for each
AWS organization, so it will vary from org to org.*

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Description: AWS Control Tower Account Factory Template (DO NOT DELETE)
Parameters:
  AccountName:
    Description: "Account name, the new managed Account will be created with this name."
    Type: String
    AllowedPattern : ".+"
  AccountEmail:
    Description: "Account email, must be unique for each AWS Account."
    Type: String
    AllowedPattern : "[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]+"
  SSOUserFirstName:
    Description:  "SSO user first name."
    Type: String
    AllowedPattern : ".+"
  SSOUserLastName:
    Description:  "SSO user last name."
    Type: String
    AllowedPattern : ".+"
  SSOUserEmail:
    Description: "SSO user email. A new SSO user will be created for this email, if it does not exist. This SSO user will be associated with the new managed Account."
    Type: String
    AllowedPattern : "[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]+"
  ManagedOrganizationalUnit:
    Description: "Your account will be added to this registered organizational unit. The list includes top-level and nested OUs registered with AWS Control Tower. You can search for an OU by name or ID. To manage these OUs, go to AWS Control Tower."
    Type: String
    AllowedValues:
      - XXX (ou-abcd-12345678)
      - YYY (ou-abcd-91011121)
      - ZZZ (ou-abcd-34151617)

<details>


```hcl

   AWS requires the account name to be at most 50 characters: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_Account.htmlorganizations-Type-Account-Name
   However, we use the account name as part of an S3 bucket name, along with a -<REGION>-tf-state suffix, which adds up to ~25 characters.
   S3 bucket names are limited to 63 characters: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html
   So, 63 - 25 = 38, so to be on the safe side, that's the limit we enforce here.
