# ECS Deploy Runner Standard Configuration module

This Terraform Module provides a streamlined interface to configure the [ecs-deploy-runner
module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci/tree/v0.52.5/modules/ecs-deploy-runner) for a standard infrastructure and applications pipeline. This includes:

*   Base pipeline of build image, update variables, deploy infrastructure with Terraform/Terragrunt.
*   Restricting git repos that can deploy infrastructure.
*   Restricting git repos that can build AMIs or Docker images.
*   Restricting parameters that can be provided to underlying scripts

## How to use the standard configuration

This module will output a map that can be passed directly into the `container_images` input variable of the
`ecs-deploy-runner` module. For example:

```hcl
module "standard_configuration" {
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci.git//modules/ecs-deploy-runner-standard-configuration?ref=v1.0.8"

  # ... other args omitted for brevity ...
}

module "ecs_deploy_runner" {
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci.git//modules/ecs-deploy-runner?ref=v1.0.8"

  container_images = module.standard_configuration.container_images

  # ... other args omitted for brevity ...
}
```

This will configure the ECS deploy runner to setup:

*   An ECS task for building docker images using [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko).
*   An ECS task for building AMIs using `packer`.
*   An ECS task for running plan to review infrastructure deployments using `terraform` and `terragrunt`.
*   An ECS task for deploying infrastructure using `terraform` and `terragrunt`.
*   Container configurations that restrict the arguments you can pass in to the scripts, such as restricting which repos
    you can deploy infrastructure from. This is derived from the arguments you pass in to this module.

## IAM Roles

Each ECS task in the standard configuration will get its own IAM role, leading to a total of four IAM roles in the
standard deployment. To ensure that each step only has the minimal permissions necessary, the following IAM permissions
are recommended for each container:

*   [docker-image-builder](#docker-image-builder)
*   [ami-builder](#ami-builder)
*   [terraform-planner](#terraform-planner)
*   [terraform-applier](#terraform-applier)

### docker-image-builder

This task should only have the permissions necessary for building your application Docker images and pushing them to
ECR (if using ECR to store images). Note that whatever permission you bind to this IAM role **will be available to the
Docker context**.

### ami-builder

This task requires enough permissions for Packer to build AMIs. This typically involves managing a new EC2 instance,
including destroying the infrastructure at the end. It is oftentimes necessary to grant full EC2 permissions for packer
to function (Allow `ec2:*` on all resources). Note that this permission **will be made available to local actions in the
packer template**.

### terraform-planner

This task requires enough permissions to run `plan` with `terraform` and `terragrunt`. This is typically limited to read
only actions, unless you have external data sources that run arbitrary scripts that have side effects. Note that this
permission **will be made available to external scripts run through `terraform` and `terragrunt`**. For example, you can
call out to the `aws` CLI from an [external data
source](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/external/data_source.html) to perform arbitrary actions against your
account. Since all PRs typically go through a plan action, it is recommended to limit the permissions to read only
access to your AWS account to limit the damage that can be done by attackers with write access to the repository.

### terraform-applier

This task requires permissions necessary to deploy infrastructure `terraform` and `terragrunt`, which typically requires
admin access. Like the `terraform-planner`, note that this permission **will be made available to external scripts run
through `terraform` and `terragrunt`**. Given the potentially powerful permissions assigned to this container, it is
important to restrict deployments to only be allowed from specific Git refs that are protected by external mechanisms
(see [Github protected branches](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches)
for more information).

## How do I invoke scripts in a given container?

You can use the [infrastructure-deployer CLI](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci/tree/v0.52.5/modules/infrastructure-deployer) to invoke a deployed ECS deploy runner. Refer
to [How do I invoke the ECS deploy runner](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci/tree/v0.52.5/modules/infrastructure-deployer/core-concepts.md#how-do-i-invoke-the-ecs-deploy-runner)
