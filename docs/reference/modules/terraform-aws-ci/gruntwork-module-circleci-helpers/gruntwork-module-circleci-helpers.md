This module contains helper scripts used in CircleCI jobs of Gruntwork Modules, including:

*   `configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module`: This script is meant to be run in a Circle CI job to configure the
    build environment for a typical Gruntwork module, including installing Terraform, Packer, Go, and Terragrunt, and
    using Go modules to install dependencies.
*   `run-go-tests`: This script is meant to be run in a CircleCI job to run automated tests written in Go with the proper
    settings for the test path (so it works with GOPATH), parallelism, and timeouts.
*   `upload-github-release-assets`: This script can be used to automatically upload assets to a [GitHub
    Release](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/). For example, if you need to build new binaries of some
    app each time you release, you can use this script to upload those binaries to GitHub.
*   `build-go-binaries`: This script is meant to be run in a CircleCI job to build binaries for an app written in Go. It
    uses gox under the hood and provides reasonable defaults for parallelism, build flags, file naming, and
    os/architecture options.

## Installing the helpers

You can install the helpers using the [Gruntwork Installer](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer):

```bash
gruntwork-install --module-name "gruntwork-module-circleci-helpers" --repo "https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci" --tag "0.0.1"
```

We recommend running this command in the `dependencies` section of `circle.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  override:
    # Install the Gruntwork Installer
    - curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer/main/bootstrap-gruntwork-installer.sh | bash /dev/stdin --version 0.0.9

    # Use the Gruntwork Installer to install the gruntwork-module-circleci-helpers module
    - gruntwork-install --module-name "gruntwork-module-circleci-helpers" --repo "https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci" --tag "0.0.5"
```

## Using the configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module helper

The `configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module` script will do the following:

1.  Install Terraform, Packer, and Go. If you wish to customize the version of each app that gets installed, you can
    use the `--terraform-version`, `--packer-version`, and `--go-version` flags, respectively.
2.  Run `go get -v -t -d` for folders you specify via the `--go-src-path` parameter.

We recommend running this helper in the `dependencies` section of `circle.yml`:

```yaml
machine:
  # Add the folders where configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module installs binaries to the PATH
  environment:
    PATH: $PATH:$HOME/terraform:$HOME/packer:$HOME/glide/linux-amd64

dependencies:
  override:
    # Install the Gruntwork Installer
    - curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer/main/bootstrap-gruntwork-installer.sh | bash /dev/stdin --version 0.0.9

    # Use the Gruntwork Installer to install the gruntwork-module-circleci-helpers module
    - gruntwork-install --module-name "gruntwork-module-circleci-helpers" --repo "https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci" --tag "0.0.1"

    # Configure the CircleCI environment using the gruntwork-module-circleci-helpers module
    - configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module --go-src-path test --go-src-path modules/my-go-app

  # Cache the folders where configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module installs binaries
  cache_directories:
    - ~/terraform
    - ~/packer
```

Three key things to note:

1.  While the `configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module` script can install Terraform, Packer, and Go, it cannot
    automatically add them to your `PATH`. Therefore, you have to do it yourself in the `machine` section of
    `circle.yml` as shown above.
2.  Use the `--go-src-path` option to tell `configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module` where your Go source files are
    located. You can specify the flag more than once if you have more than one Go app, as shown in the example above.
    The `configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module` script will run `go get -v -t -d` in each of those folders to
    install their dependencies.
3.  To avoid reinstalling Terraform, Packer, and Glide over and over again, use `cache_directories` as shown above.

## Using the run-go-tests helper

The `run-go-tests` can run automated tests written in Go with the proper settings for the test path (so it works with
GOPATH), parallelism, and timeouts.

We recommend running this helper in the `test` section of `circle.yml`:

```yaml

test:
  override:
    - run-go-tests --path test
```

A few things to note:

1.  Use the `--path` parameter to tell `run-go-tests` where your tests are located. The path should be relative to your
    project root. The default is the present working directory, which in Circle CI, is the root of your Git checkout.
2.  Use the `--packages` parameter to specify which packages to test. The default is the output of running
    `glide novendor` in `--path`.
3.  The `run-go-tests` script will add a `-short` parameter to the test command when not running on the main branch.
    Your tests can read in the value of this flag [as shown here](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/) to determine if a
    long-running test should be executed or not.

### Passing extra arguments

Sometimes, you might find that you need to tweak a few options to make your go tests run a certain way,
usually to help in debugging them.
To achieve this, you're able to pass extra command line arguments to the `go test` command
through a commit message.
For example, to run a specific test, your last commit could look something like this:

```
Some commit message. [go-test-args=-run SomeTestFunc]
```

Now when you push to the CI server, only `SomeTestFunc` is tested. You are able to set multiple options
as you normally would in the command line:

```
Some commit message. [go-test-args=-run SomeTestFunc -cpu 2]
```

## Using the upload-github-release-assets helper

To use this helper, you must first create a [GitHub access
token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) and set it as the environment
variable `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN`.

After that, in CircleCI, you can run the `upload-github-release-assets` script as follows:

```
upload-github-release-assets /assets-to-upload/file1 /assets-to-upload/file2 /assets-to-upload/file3
```

You can also use bash parameter expansion:

```
upload-github-release-assets /assets-to-upload/*
```

That is, you just pass in a list of assets to upload, and the script will automatically figure out the proper GitHub
repo and tag to use based on [CircleCI environment variables](https://circleci.com/docs/environment-variables/). If
you're not using CircleCI or want to customize some of the settings, you may use the following options:

*   `--github-repo-owner`: The user or organization that owns the repo (e.g. gruntwork-io).
*   `--github-repo-name`: The name of the repo (e.g. terraform-aws-ci).
*   `--git-tag`: The git tag for which assets should be pushed (e.g. v0.0.3).

## Using the build-go-binaries helper

This script accepts the following options:

*   `--src-path`: The path, relative to the project root, where Go source files can be found. Default: current working
    directory.
*   `--dest-path`: The path, relative to the project root, in which the binaries should be created.
*   `--app-name`: What to name the Go binaries.
*   `--os`: The OS's to build binaries for.
*   `--arch`: The architectures to build binaries for.

Example:

```
build-go-binaries --app-name myapp --src-path foo/bar --dest-path foo/bin
```

This will create 32 bit and 64 bit binaries for Linux, OS X, and Windows in the `foo/bin` folder with the name
`myapp_<os>_<arch>` (e.g. `myapp_linux_amd64`, `myapp_windows_386.exe`, etc).

If you run `build-go-binaries` with no options, it will build the source code in the current working directory into a
`bin` folder and pick reasonable defaults for all the other values using [CircleCI environment
variables](https://circleci.com/docs/environment-variables/).
