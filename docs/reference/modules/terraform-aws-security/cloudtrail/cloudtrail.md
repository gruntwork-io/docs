<a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/releases/tag/v0.68.0" className="link-button" title="Release notes for only versions which impacted this module.">Release Notes</a>

This Terraform Module configures [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/), a service for logging every API call made against your AWS account.

![AWS CloudTrail Architecture](/img/reference/modules/terraform-aws-security/cloudtrail/aws-cloudtrail-architecture.png)

## Features

*   Enable CloudTrail in your AWS account.

*   Create an S3 bucket to store all CloudTrail events.

*   Create a KMS master key to encrypt all CloudTrail events.

*   Configure how long to retain CloudTrail log data and how to guarantee CloudTrail log integrity.

## Learn

   Ideally, this would be a map(object({...})), but the Terraform object type constraint doesn't support optional
   parameters, whereas IAM policy statements have many optional params. And we can't even use map(any), as the
   Terraform map type constraint requires all values to have the same type ("shape"), but as each object in the map
   may specify different optional params, this won't work either. So, sadly, we are forced to fall back to "any."

                                       that you can use with the readOnly, eventCategory, and resources.type fields.
   - not_equals        list(string)  : A list of values that excludes events that match the exact value of the event
                                       record field specified as the value of field.
   - starts_with       list(string)  : A list of values that includes events that match the first few characters of the
                                       event record field specified as the value of field.
   - not_starts_with   list(string)  : A list of values that excludes events that match the first few characters of the
                                       event record field specified as the value of field.
   - ends_with         list(string)  : A list of values that includes events that match the last few characters of the
                                       event record field specified as the value of field.
   - not_ends_with     list(string)  : A list of values that excludes events that match the last few characters of the
                                       event record field specified as the value of field.

When true, all IAM policies will be managed as dedicated policies rather than inline policies attached to the IAM roles.

As such, it is important to avoid inline policies when targeting compliance with various security standards.
