# Private S3 Bucket

<a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/tree/pete%2F778%2Fbucket-ownership/modules/private-s3-bucket" className="link-button" title="View the source code for this module in GitHub.">View Source</a>

<a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/releases/tag/v0.68.3" className="link-button" title="Release notes for only versions which impacted this module.">Release Notes</a>

This module can be used to create and manage an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket that enforces
best practices for private access:

*   No public access: all public access is completely blocked.
*   Encryption at rest: server-side encryption is enabled, optionally with a custom KMS key.
*   Encryption in transit: the bucket can only be accessed over TLS.

## How do you enable MFA Delete?

Enabling MFA Delete in your bucket adds another layer of security by requiring MFA in any request to delete a version or change the versioning state of the bucket.

The attribute `mfa_delete` is only used by Terraform to [reflect the current state of the bucket](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3\_bucket#mfa_delete). It is not possible to create a bucket if the `mfa_delete` is `true`, because it needs to be activated [using AWS CLI or the API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete.html).

To make this change [**you need to use the root user of the account**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root) that owns the bucket, and MFA needs to be enabled.

**Note:** We do not recommend you have active access keys for the root user, so remember to delete them after you finish this.

In order to enable MFA Delete, you need to:

1.  [Create access keys for the root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#id_root-user_manage_add-key)
2.  [Configure MFA for the root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#id_root-user_manage_mfa)
3.  Create a bucket with `mfa_delete=false`.
4.  Using the root user, call the AWS CLI to enable MFA Delete. If you are using `aws-vault`, it is necessary to [use the `--no-session` flag](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/blob/7d912c9/USAGE.md#using---no-session).
    ```
    aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --region <REGION> \
    --bucket <BUCKET NAME> \
    --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled \
    --mfa "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT ID>:mfa/root-account-mfa-device <MFA CODE>"
    ```
5.  Set `mfa_delete=true` in your Terraform code
6.  Remove any Lifecycle Rule that the bucket might contain (for the `aws-config-bucket` and `cloudtrail-bucket` modules, enabling `mfa_delete` will already disable the lifecycle rules).
7.  Run `terraform apply`.
8.  If there are no left S3 buckets to enable MFA Delete, delete the access keys for the root user, but NOT the MFA.

**Note:** If you are using `aws-vault` to authenticate your requests, you need to use the `--no-session` flag.

### Using mfa-delete.sh

If you want to enable MFA Delete to *all* your buckets at once, you can use the script at `mfa-delete-script/mfa-delete.sh`. You need to use the access keys for the root user and the root MFA code.

Usage:

```
aws-vault exec --no-session <PROFILE> -- ./mfa-delete.sh --account-id <ACCOUNT ID>
```

Example:

```
aws-vault exec --no-session root-prod -- ./mfa-delete.sh --account-id 226486542153
```

### Known Issues

*   `An error occurred (InvalidRequest) when calling the PutBucketVersioning operation: DevPay and Mfa are mutually exclusive authorization methods`: If you receive this error when running any of the commands/scripts above then you might not be authenticated as the root user or MFA may not be enabled correctly. If you are using `aws-vault` to authenticate your requests, you need to use the `--no-session` flag.

   Ideally, this would be a map(object({...})), but the Terraform object type constraint doesn't support optional
   parameters, whereas IAM policy statements have many optional params. And we can't even use map(any), as the
   Terraform map type constraint requires all values to have the same type ("shape"), but as each object in the map
   may specify different optional params, this won't work either. So, sadly, we are forced to fall back to "any."

   Ideally, this would be a list(object({...})), but the Terraform object type constraint doesn't support optional
   parameters, whereas replication rules have many optional params. And we can't even use list(any), as the Terraform
   list type constraint requires all values to have the same type ("shape"), but as each object in the list may specify
   different optional params, this won't work either. So, sadly, we are forced to fall back to "any."

<HclListItem name="create_replication_iam_role_to_bucket" requirement="optional" type="bool">
<HclListItemDescription>

When true, provision an IAM role that allows various source buckets to replicate to this bucket. Note that this setting should be used if you intend to use this bucket as a replication destination, NOT replication source. For configuring replication from the bucket, refer to the <a href="#replication_enabled"><code>replication_enabled</code></a> input variable.

<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="false"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="create_resources" requirement="optional" type="bool">
<HclListItemDescription>

Set to false to have this module skip creating resources. This weird parameter exists solely because Terraform does not support conditional modules. Therefore, this is a hack to allow you to conditionally decide if the resources in this module should be created or not.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="true"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="custom_iam_role_name_for_replication_role" requirement="optional" type="string">

<HclListItem name="enable_versioning" requirement="optional" type="bool">
<HclListItemDescription>

Set to true to enable versioning for this bucket. If enabled, instead of overriding objects, the S3 bucket will always create a new version of each object, so all the old values are retained.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="true"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="force_destroy" requirement="optional" type="bool">
<HclListItemDescription>

If set to true, when you run 'terraform destroy', delete all objects from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. Warning: these objects are not recoverable so only use this if you're absolutely sure you want to permanently delete everything!

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="false"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="iam_role_permissions_boundary" requirement="optional" type="string">
<HclListItemDescription>

The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the IAM role

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="null"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItemDescription>

Optional KMS key to use for encrypting data in the S3 bucket. If null, data in S3 will be encrypted using the default aws/s3 key. If provided, the key policy of the provided key must allow whoever is writing to this bucket to use that key.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="null"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="lifecycle_rules" requirement="optional" type="any">
<HclListItemDescription>

The lifecycle rules for this S3 bucket. These can be used to change storage types or delete objects based on customizable rules. This should be a map, where each key is a unique ID for the lifecycle rule, and each value is an object that contains the parameters defined in the comment above.

<HclListItem name="mfa_delete" requirement="optional" type="bool">
<HclListItemDescription>

Enable MFA delete for either 'Change the versioning state of your bucket' or 'Permanently delete an object version'. This cannot be used to toggle this setting but is available to allow managed buckets to reflect the state in AWS. Only used if enable_versioning is true. CIS v1.4 requires this variable to be true. If you do not wish to be CIS-compliant, you can set it to false.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="null"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="object_lock_default_retention_enabled" requirement="optional" type="bool">
<HclListItemDescription>

Set to true to configure a default retention period for object locks when Object Locking is enabled. When disabled, objects will not be protected with locking by default unless explicitly configured at object creation time. Only used if object_lock_enabled is true.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="true"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="object_lock_enabled" requirement="optional" type="bool">
<HclListItemDescription>

Set to true to enable Object Locking. This prevents objects from being deleted for a customizable period of time. Note that this MUST be configured at bucket creation time - you cannot update an existing bucket to enable object locking unless you go through AWS support. Additionally, this is not reversible - once a bucket is created with object lock enabled, you cannot disable object locking even with this setting. Note that enabling object locking will automatically enable bucket versioning.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="false"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="object_lock_mode" requirement="optional" type="string">
<HclListItemDescription>

The default Object Lock retention mode you want to apply to new objects placed in this bucket. Valid values are GOVERNANCE and COMPLIANCE. Only used if object_lock_enabled and object_lock_default_retention_enabled are true.

<HclListItemDescription>

When true, all IAM policies will be managed as dedicated policies rather than inline policies attached to the IAM roles. Dedicated managed policies are friendlier to automated policy checkers, which may scan a single resource for findings. As such, it is important to avoid inline policies when targeting compliance with various security standards.
