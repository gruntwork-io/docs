# SSH Grunt

This module can configure a Linux server to manage SSH access to the server via an Identity Provider (IdP). Via AWS [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/), developers in certain IAM Groups will be able to SSH to your servers using their IAM user name and the SSH key they uploaded to their IAM user account.

## Features

*   Automatically sync user accounts from your identity provider (e.g., IAM, Google, ADFS) to your servers, so each developer can have their own user name (e.g. "susan", "jim") rather than everyone using a shared user (e.g. "ubuntu", "ec2-user").

*   Each developer uses their own SSH keys to connect to servers (instead of a single, shared Key Pair).

*   Quickly use IAM to rotate old keys and upload a new one

*   Revoke SSH access to servers from the centralized IdP

## Conflicts with ec2-instance-connect

AWS has a similar service in [EC2 Instance Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Connect-using-EC2-Instance-Connect.html). There are pros and cons to each service. For example, with `ssh-grunt`, there is no additional client-side tooling required beyond the native SSH that you have already. Connection is a one step process of SSHing to your target instance. With EC2 Instance Connect, in order to use native SSH, you must first [use the AWS CLI to push your key up to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-connect-methods.html).

EC2 Instance Connect is installed by default in recent AWS AMIs, including Ubuntu 20.04. It conflicts with `ssh-grunt` due to both services relying on SSH’s AuthorizedKeysCommand. In order to make `ssh-grunt` work properly, you’ll need to uninstall the `ec2-instance-connect` package.

On installation, `ssh-grunt` will detect if `ec2-instance-connect` is installed and halt.
