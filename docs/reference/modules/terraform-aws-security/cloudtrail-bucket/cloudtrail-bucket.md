# CloudTrail Bucket

<a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/tree/v0.69.1/modules/cloudtrail-bucket" className="link-button" title="View the source code for this module in GitHub.">View Source</a>

<a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/releases/tag/v0.69.1" className="link-button" title="Release notes for only versions which impacted this module.">Release Notes</a>

This module creates an S3 bucket for storing CloudTrail data and a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) for encrypting that
data, including all the appropriate lifecycle, encryption, and permission settings for CloudTrail.

This module is used under the hood in the [cloudtrail](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/tree/v0.69.1/modules/cloudtrail)
and [account-baseline-root](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/tree/v0.69.1/modules/account-baseline-root) modules.

It can also be used directly when configuring cross account access, for example when it is desirable to [have the central Cloudtrail S3 bucket exist outside of the management account.](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/tree/v0.69.1/modules/cloudtrail/core-concepts.md#multi-account-cloudtrail-setup-storing-the-cloudtrail-bucket-in-an-account-other-than-the-management-account)

   - principals                                  map(list(string)) (optional): The principals to which this statement applies. The keys are the principal type ("AWS", "Service", or "Federated") and the value is a list of identifiers.

   - values                                      list(string)      (required):  The values to evaluate the condition against. If multiple values are provided, the condition matches if at least one of them applies. (That is, the tests are combined with the "OR" boolean operation.)

```hcl

   Ideally, this would be a map(object({...})), but the Terraform object type constraint doesn't support optional
   parameters, whereas IAM policy statements have many optional params. And we can't even use map(any), as the
   Terraform map type constraint requires all values to have the same type ("shape"), but as each object in the map
   may specify different optional params, this won't work either. So, sadly, we are forced to fall back to "any."

<HclListItemDescription>

If set to true, that means the KMS key you're using already exists, and does not need to be created.

</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="kms_key_arn" requirement="optional" type="string">
<HclListItemDescription>

If you wish to specify a custom KMS key, then specify the key arn using this variable. This is especially useful when using CloudTrail with multiple AWS accounts, so the logs are all encrypted using the same key.

      test = string

<HclListItem name="mfa_delete" requirement="optional" type="bool">
<HclListItemDescription>

Enable MFA delete for either 'Change the versioning state of your bucket' or 'Permanently delete an object version'. This cannot be used to toggle this setting but is available to allow managed buckets to reflect the state in AWS. For instructions on how to enable MFA Delete, check out the README from the private-s3-bucket module. CIS v1.4 requires this variable to be true. If you do not wish to be CIS-compliant, you can set it to false.

```hcl

   Ideally, this would be a list(object({...})), but the Terraform object type constraint doesn't support optional
   parameters, whereas replication rules have many optional params. And we can't even use list(any), as the Terraform
   list type constraint requires all values to have the same type ("shape"), but as each object in the list may specify
   different optional params, this won't work either. So, sadly, we are forced to fall back to "any."
