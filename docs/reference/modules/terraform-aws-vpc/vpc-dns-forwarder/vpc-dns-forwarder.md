This Terraform Module creates [Route 53
Resolvers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-getting-started.html) between VPCs so that
DNS queries for specific domains in a VPC can be forwarded to another VPC over a peered network. This is useful when you
would like to resolve Route 53 private hosted zones, which are typically not available over a peered network.

For example, EKS supports private API endpoints, which restricts access to the Kubernetes API to be within the VPC.
However, the hostname for the internal endpoint is only resolvable from within the housing VPC because they are defined
by a private hosted zone under the hood. This breaks our model of having a management VPC that acts as the entrypoint
into the network. EKS clusters will typically be launched into the application VPC, which means the private endpoints
are only addressable in the application VPC. However, operators need access to the endpoint to manage the cluster, but
they only have access to VPN into the management VPC, which has a peering connection to the application VPC. To allow
operators to properly resolve the hostname, they will need to be able to resolve it from within the management VPC. This
can be done by creating a Route 53 Resolver that forwards DNS queries for the EKS endpoint originating in the management
VPC to the application VPC's DNS resolver.

**NOTE**: In order for Route 53 Resolvers to work, the peering connection must allow remote VPC DNS resolution on both
accepter and requester side of the connection peering.

## What is a Route 53 Resolver?

A Route 53 Resolver is a DNS server that answers DNS queries for VPC domain names that are internal to the VPC, such as
VPC endpoints and private hosted zones. Normally such DNS queries are limited to those originating from the housing VPC,
and therefore are not typically resolved for peering VPCs. Route 53 Resolvers allow you to link the DNS resolvers
between multiple VPCs by forwarding specific domain DNS requests to other VPCs' DNS resolvers so that you can resolve
private endpoints internal to the target VPC.

## How do you specify the hostnames that use the forwarder?

By default, no DNS query will be routed through the Route 53 Resolvers created by this module. You need to create
forwarding rules that specify which specific domains should be resolved through the Route 53 Resolvers created by this
module. You can use the [vpc-dns-forwarder-rules module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/v0.26.5/modules/vpc-dns-forwarder-rules) to construct the forwarding rules.
