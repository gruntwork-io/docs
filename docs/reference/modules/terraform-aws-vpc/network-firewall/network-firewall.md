# Network Firewall Terraform Module - Beta

<a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/v0.28.3/modules/network-firewall" className="link-button" title="View the source code for this module in GitHub.">View Source</a>

<a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/releases/tag/v0.28.0" className="link-button" title="Release notes for only versions which impacted this module.">Release Notes</a>

This Terraform module deploys Network Firewall resources. It is a managed service that allows you to filter and monitor network traffic.
The module creates Network Firewall, Network Firewall Policy and Network Firewall Rule Group.

This is a BETA release.

## Planned Features

*   Custom actions are not implemented.
*   TLS inspection configuration is not implemented.
*   Network Firewall Resource Policy is not implemented.
*   Reference sets (reference to prefixes list) are not implemented.
*   Logging Configuration is not implemented.
*   Proper update operation for Rule Groups is not implemented (Automatic Rule Dissassoiation is not supported, currently requires redeployment).

## Limitations

### 1. Availability Zones Constraints

AWS Network Firewall deployment is not supported in certain Availability Zones (AZs). The official documentation lacks clear specification of supported AZs. For example, the [Configuring Network Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/vpc-config-subnets.html) page omits AZ limitations, while the [Troubleshooting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/troubleshooting-general-issues.html#troubleshoot-unsupported-az) page acknowledges but provides no specific details about AZ limitations (as of October 2024).

AWS Technical Support has confirmed their internal service team's awareness of this limitation. They recommend attempting deployment in specific AZs to verify support. Based on empirical testing across 17 default-enabled regions, this constraint affects only the `use1-az3` availability zone in the `us-east-1` region. Note that opt-in regions were not included in this analysis.

## Usage

For usage examples, check out the [One VPC](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/v0.28.3/examples/vpc-app-with-network-firewall/) and [Multi-VPC](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/v0.28.3/examples/vpc-app-with-network-firewall-and-transit-gateway/) deployment.

## Deployment models for AWS Network Firewall

### Single VPC, One AZ

By default, any traffic from a source within a VPC destined to a target within the same VPC is covered by the local route and therefore directly routed. The enhancement allows you to configure more specific routes at a subnet route table level or replace target for the “local” destination with a middlebox such as firewall endpoint. The key use case is insertion of a middlebox between two subnets for inter-subnet traffic (east-west) inspection. For example, you can create routing rules to send all traffic from a subnet to a network firewall endpoint when the destination is a specific subnet.

### Single VPC, Multi-AZ

When you build highly available applications on AWS, you can partition your application to run across multiple AZs. At AWS, we have a principle of keeping AZ independence (AZI) which means all packet flows stay within the Availability Zone rather than crossing boundaries. Network traffic is kept local to the AZ. In such scenario, it is easy to maintain traffic symmetry.

### Multi-VPC, Multi-AZ (Combined East-West and North-South Inspection with Transit Gateway)

Use AWS Transit Gateway to centralize the East/West inspection between VPCs, while you have a NAT gateway in the
Inspection VPC for centralized egress and the North/South inspection.

East/West Traffic Inspection:

1.  Traffic from an instance in Spoke VPC A destined to another instance in Spoke VPC B (East/West traffic) is routed to the Transit Gateway.
2.  The Transit Gateway route table associated with the attachment sends all the traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the Inspection VPC.
3.  The Inspection VPC TGW subnet route table sends all the traffic to the firewall endpoint. The allowed traffic is forwarded back to the TGW ENI.
4.  As per the Transit Gateway route table associated with the Inspection VPC, the traffic is sent to Spoke VPC B.
5.  Finally, in the TGW subnet route table of the Spoke VPC B, the traffic is sent to the destination – 10.2.1.10.

North/South Traffic Inspection:

1.  Traffic from an instance in Spoke VPC B destined to the internet (North/South traffic) is routed to the Transit Gateway.
2.  The Transit Gateway route table associated with the attachment sends all the traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the Inspection VPC.
3.  The Inspection VPC TGW subnet route table sends all the traffic to the firewall endpoint, where it is transparently analyzed.
4.  Allowed traffic is sent to the NAT gateway as per the Firewall subnet route table.
5.  The private IP of the client is translated to the private IP of the NAT gateway, and in turn, translated to the public IP by the internet gateway.

It is recommended to use Transit Gateway appliance mode in the Inspection VPC Transit Gateway attachment to maintain flow symmetry.
