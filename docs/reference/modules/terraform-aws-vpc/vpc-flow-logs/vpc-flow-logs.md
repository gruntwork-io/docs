# VPC Flow Logs Terraform Module

<a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/releases/tag/v0.26.6" className="link-button" title="Release notes for only versions which impacted this module.">Release Notes</a>

This Terraform Module creates a [VPC flow log](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html). The flow log will capture IP traffic information for a given VPC, subnet, or [Elastic Network Interface (ENI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html). Flow logs can be configured to capture all traffic, only traffic that is accepted, or only traffic that is rejected. The logs can be published to [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) or an S3 bucket.

## What are VPC Flow Logs?

VPC Flow Logs are a feature to help you understand, debug, and evaluate the network traffic in your VPCs. Flow logs will capture information such as the client IP address and port, the protocol,
whether traffic was accepted or rejected (e.g. due to a security group rule forbidding such traffic), and other
metadata about the request and response.

For example, consider the following flow log record:

```
2 318677964956 eni-0a4c0daa903d85a52 209.17.96.58 10.0.3.254 55428 139 6 1 44 1565031303 1565031350 REJECT OK
```

This shows a single rejected packet of 44 bytes from `209.17.96.58` port `55428` to `10.0.3.254` (an internal VPC address) port `139` (Windows SMB protocol) on interface `eni-0a4c0daa903d85a52`. The packet  was sent between `Monday, August 5, 2019 6:55:03 PM` and `Monday, August 5, 2019 6:55:50 PM`. For a complete description of the fields, refer to the [Flow Log Records documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html#flow-log-records).

This particular flow log record was recorded from a newly created EC2 instance running Linux, and yet the packet is destined for port 139 using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, an antiquated file sharing protocol for Windows. Why would this occur? Because publicly routable IP addresses are continuously barraged by probes from malicious hosts seeking vulnerable systems to compromise. This is one reason why it is crucial to have a [battle-tested, production-grade network architecture](https://www.gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/) that limits [attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface) and enforces [segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_segmentation).

VPC Flow Logs do not capture packet payloads. You can use [VPC Traffic Mirroring](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-vpc-traffic-mirroring/) if you wish to capture packets/payloads. Furthermore, flow logs do not capture all IP traffic. For a list of flow log limitations, consult the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html#flow-logs-limitations).

## How are VPC Flow Logs useful?

Flow Logs can help to define [least privilege permissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) for security group rules. They can also help to identify malicious network activity to prevent or respond to an attack. Flow logs are required by some information security standards, such as the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark.

## Resources Created

*   **Flow Log:** A flow log attached to a VPC, subnet, or ENI
*   **CloudWatch Log Group:** If using the CloudWatch Logs destination for flow logs, we create a cloudwatch log group
*   **IAM Role and Policy for CloudWatch Logs:** The flow logs service [requires an IAM role with permission to publish to CloudWatch logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs-cwl.html)
*   **S3 Bucket:** If using S3 as the destination for flow logs, we create an S3 bucket with a [lifecycle policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html) and [encryption using KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html)
*   **KMS Key:** If using S3, we create a KMS key, or allow you to pass in your own.

## How do I view Flow Logs?

The easiest way to use Flow Logs is to configure the CloudWatch Logs destination and use the web console. The [available fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html#flow-log-records) in a flow log record tell you information about IP traffic such as source and destination address and port, protocol, bytes and packets sent, whether the traffic was accepted or rejected, and more.

If you use an S3 destination, [flow log files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs-s3.html#flow-logs-s3-path) are delivered in to the s3 bucket 5 minute intervals.

Flow log records are overwhelming for humans to review. You can use [Amazon Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html) to [query VPC flow logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/vpc-flow-logs.html) using SQL syntax. You can also use [Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/) to automatically evaluate flow logs.

## What is the difference between using Flow Logs with VPC, subnets, and ENIs?

The difference has to do with how many resources are sending flow logs.

*   If you create a flow log with `eni_id`, it will include the data for a single elastic network interface only
*   If you create a flow log with `subnet_id`, it will include the data for any network interface created within the given subnet
*   If you create a flow log with `vpc_id`, it will include the data for any network interface created within the given VPC

## Using KMS keys to encrypt flow logs

Flow logs can be encrypted using the [AWS Key Management Service (KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/). You can provide the ARN of an KMS key, or the module will create one if an ARN is not provided. If you choose to supply an existing key, you must ensure that the appropriate key policy is configured. Refer to the documentation for flow logs published to [CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/encrypt-log-data-kms.html) and to [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs-s3.html#flow-logs-s3-cmk-policy) respectively as they differ slightly. See also the comments in the `kms_key_policy` resource.

   - values           list(string)      (required): The values to evaluate the condition against. If multiple values
                                                    are provided, the condition matches if at least one of them
                                                    applies. (That is, the tests are combined with the "OR" boolean
                                                    operation.)

   Ideally, this would be a map(object({...})), but the Terraform object type constraint doesn't support optional
   parameters, whereas IAM policy statements have many optional params. And we can't even use map(any), as the
   Terraform map type constraint requires all values to have the same type ("shape"), but as each object in the map
   may specify different optional params, this won't work either. So, sadly, we are forced to fall back to "any."
