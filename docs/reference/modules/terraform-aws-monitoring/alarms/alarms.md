This folder contains modules that configure [CloudWatch
Alarms](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) to go off and
email or SMS you when something is going wrong. The modules are:

*   [asg-cpu-alarms](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/asg-cpu-alarms): An alarm that goes off if CPU usage in an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is too high.
*   [asg-disk-alarms](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/asg-disk-alarms): An alarm that goes off if disk usage in an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is too high.
*   [asg-memory-alarms](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/asg-memory-alarms): An alarm that goes off if memory usage in an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is
    too high.
*   [ec2-cpu-alarms](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/ec2-cpu-alarms): An alarm that goes off if CPU usage for an EC2 Instance is too high.
*   [ec2-disk-alarms](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/ec2-disk-alarms): An alarm that goes off if disk usage for an EC2 Instance is too high.
*   [ec2-memory-alarms](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/ec2-memory-alarms): An alarm that goes off if memory usage for an EC2 Instance is too high.
*   [ecs-cluster-alamrs](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/ecs-cluster-alarms): Alarms for an ECS cluster that go off if CPU or memory usage is too high
    across the cluster.
*   [ecs-service-alamrs](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/ecs-cluster-alarms): Alarms for an ECS service that go off if CPU or memory usage is too high
    for this service.
*   [elb-alarms](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/elb-alarms): A set of ELB alarms that go off if the latency gets too high, or there are
    too many 5xx errors, or too few requests are coming in.
*   [lambda-alarms](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/lambda-alarms): An alarm that goes off when a lambda function breaches an associated metric.
*   [rds-alarms](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/rds-alarms): A set of RDS alarms that go off if the CPU usage, number of connections, or latency gets
    too high or if the available memory or disk space gets too low.
*   [route53-health-check-alarms](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/route53-health-check-alarms): Monitor a given domain (e.g. example.com) using Route
    53 and trigger an alarm if that domain is down or unresponsive.
*   [scheduled-job-alarm](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/scheduled-job-alarm): An alarm that goes off if a scheduled job (e.g. a cron job) fails to
    run.
*   [sqs-alarms](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring/tree/v0.36.8/modules/alarms/sqs-alarms): Alarms that go off if the number of visible messages is too high or age of oldest message surpasses the threshold.

## Information regarding tags for metric alarms

Currently you can view tags related to metric alarms only with AWS CLI by using:

```
aws cloudwatch list-tags-for-resource --resource-arn alarm_arn
```

Tags associated with a metric alarm are not propagated with the alarm payload when the alarm is triggered.
