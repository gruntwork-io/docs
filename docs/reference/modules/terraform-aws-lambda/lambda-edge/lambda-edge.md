# Lambda@Edge Function Module

<a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-lambda/releases/tag/v0.21.13" className="link-button" title="Release notes for only versions which impacted this module.">Release Notes</a>

This module makes it easy to deploy and manage an [AWS Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/) function.
Lambda@Edge gives you a way to run code on-demand in AWS Edge locations without having to manage servers.

Lambda@Edge has the following limitations compared to regular Lambda (see
[the CloudFront Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-requirements-limits.html)
for the full details):

*   The functions must not have any environment variables.
*   The execution timeout must not be higher than 30 seconds.
*   The function must be versioned in order to be a target for Cloudfront events.
*   The function must be deployed in the `us-east-1` region.
*   The function runtime must be one of:
    *   `nodejs10.x` or newer
    *   `python3.7` or newer

## What is AWS Lambda?

[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You define a
function in a supported language (currently: Python, JavaScript, Java, and C#), upload the code to Lambda, specify how
that function can be triggered, and then AWS Lambda takes care of all the details of deploying and scaling the
infrastructure to run that code.

## How do you add additional IAM policies and permissions?

By default, the `lambda-edge` module configures your lambda function with an IAM role that allows it to write logs to
CloudWatch Logs. The ID of the IAM role is exported as the output `iam_role_id` and the ID of the lambda function is
exported as the output `function_arn`, so you can add custom rules using the `aws_iam_role_policy` or
`aws_lambda_permission` resources, respectively. For example, to allow your lambda function to be triggered by SNS:

```hcl
module "my_lambda_function" {
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-lambda.git//modules/lambda-edge?ref=v1.0.8"
  # (params omitted)
}

resource "aws_lambda_permission" "with_sns" {
  statement_id = "AllowExecutionFromSNS"
  action = "lambda:InvokeFunction"
  function_name = "${module.my_lambda_function.function_arn}"
  principal = "sns.amazonaws.com"
  source_arn = "${aws_sns_topic.default.arn}"
}
```

## How to get the logs of your function

Lambda@Edge stores CloudWatch Logs in the AWS Regions closest to the location where the function receives traffic and is
executed. That means a log group must be created in every region that have [Regional Edge Caches](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/aggregating-lambdaedge-logs/).
Instructions on how to do this can be found at the   [`lambda-edge-multi-region-log-groups` module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-lambda/tree/v0.21.13/modules/lambda-edge-multi-region-log-groups). To see which regions are receiving traffic, you can find graphs of metrics for the
function on the CloudFront console and choose your region there.

## How to trigger this Lambda function from Cloudfront

This module deploys the Lambda function but doesn't create any CloudFront trigger. There are two ways to create those
triggers:

1.  Using terraform. To link the Lambda@Edge function to the [s3-cloudfront module from
    terraform-aws-static-assets](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-static-assets/tree/main/modules/s3-cloudfront),
    you can use the
    [default_lambda_associations](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-static-assets/blob/main/modules/s3-cloudfront/variables.tf#L308)
    input variable.
2.  Manually from the AWS Console as described in the
    [Lambda@Edge documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html#lambda-edge-add-triggers)

<HclListItem name="reserved_concurrent_executions" requirement="optional" type="number">
<HclListItemDescription>

The amount of reserved concurrent executions for this lambda function or -1 if unreserved.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="null"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="runtime" requirement="optional" type="string">
<HclListItemDescription>

The runtime environment for the Lambda function (e.g. nodejs, python3.9, java8). See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_CreateFunction.html#SSS-CreateFunction-request-Runtime for all possible values. Currently Lambda@Edge supports only nodejs10.x and python3.7.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="&quot;nodejs10.x&quot;"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="s3_bucket" requirement="optional" type="string">
<HclListItemDescription>

An S3 bucket location containing the function's deployment package. Exactly one of <a href="#source_path"><code>source_path</code></a> or the <a href="#s3_xxx"><code>s3_xxx</code></a> variables must be specified.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="null"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="s3_key" requirement="optional" type="string">
<HclListItemDescription>

The path within <a href="#s3_bucket"><code>s3_bucket</code></a> where the deployment package is located. Exactly one of <a href="#source_path"><code>source_path</code></a> or the <a href="#s3_xxx"><code>s3_xxx</code></a> variables must be specified.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="null"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="s3_object_version" requirement="optional" type="string">
<HclListItemDescription>

The version of the path in <a href="#s3_key"><code>s3_key</code></a> to use as the deployment package. Exactly one of <a href="#source_path"><code>source_path</code></a> or the <a href="#s3_xxx"><code>s3_xxx</code></a> variables must be specified.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="null"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="set_source_code_hash" requirement="optional" type="bool">
<HclListItemDescription>

If set to false, this function will no longer set the source_code_hash parameter, so this module will no longer detect and upload changes to the deployment package. This is primarily useful if you update the Lambda function from outside of this module (e.g., you have scripts that do it separately) and want to avoid a plan diff. Used only if <a href="#source_path"><code>source_path</code></a> is non-empty.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="true"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="skip_zip" requirement="optional" type="bool">
<HclListItemDescription>

Set to true to skip zip archive creation and assume that <a href="#source_path"><code>source_path</code></a> points to a pregenerated zip archive.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="false"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="source_path" requirement="optional" type="string">
<HclListItemDescription>

The path to the directory that contains your Lambda function source code. This code will be zipped up and uploaded to Lambda as your deployment package. If <a href="#skip_zip"><code>skip_zip</code></a> is set to true, then this is assumed to be the path to an already-zipped file, and it will be uploaded directly to Lambda as a deployment package. Exactly one of <a href="#source_path"><code>source_path</code></a> or the <a href="#s3_xxx"><code>s3_xxx</code></a> variables must be specified.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="null"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="tags" requirement="optional" type="map(string)">
<HclListItemDescription>

A map of tags to apply to the Lambda function.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="{}"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="use_managed_iam_policies" requirement="optional" type="bool">
<HclListItemDescription>

When true, all IAM policies will be managed as dedicated policies rather than inline policies attached to the IAM roles. Dedicated managed policies are friendlier to automated policy checkers, which may scan a single resource for findings. As such, it is important to avoid inline policies when targeting compliance with various security standards.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="true"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="zip_exclude_files" requirement="optional" type="list(string)">
<HclListItemDescription>

Files in <a href="#source_path"><code>source_path</code></a> to ignore when zipping the directory in addition to .terragrunt-source-manifest.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="[]"/>
</HclListItem>

<HclListItem name="zip_output_path" requirement="optional" type="string">
<HclListItemDescription>

The path to store the output zip file of your source code. If empty, defaults to module path. This should be the full path to the zip file, not a directory.

</HclListItemDescription>
<HclListItemDefaultValue defaultValue="null"/>
</HclListItem>
