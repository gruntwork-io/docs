# Overview

The Gruntwork.io GitHub App is used to provide authentication from your GitHub organization to access Gruntwork code, and to perform actions in GitHub workflows.

Installing the GitHub App is required for bootsrapping IaC Foundations, and when running Gruntwork Pipelines.

It is also the default mechanism by which Gruntwork Pipelines will authenticate with GitHub to perform actions in your repositories.

More information on the architecture of the Gruntwork.io GitHub App can be found [here](./architecture.mdx).
