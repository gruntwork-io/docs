# Using envcommon in an infrastructure-unit

## infrastructure-unit

An infrastructure unit is the Gruntwork term for the deployment of an infrastructure as code module in a single environment. For example, deploying the [`vpc-app`](../../reference/modules/terraform-aws-vpc/vpc-app/) module in your development AWS account is a single infrastructure-unit.

In this section, we'll walk through the approach we employ at Gruntwork for leveraging modules in envcommon as infrastructure-units. When you purchase a DevOps Foundation, the generated repository containing your infrastructure as code is automatically laid out to use this approach.

## The Terraform block

Gruntwork recommends that infrastructure-unit definitions contain a `terraform` block, in addition the the `terraform` block in the underlying envcommon module. This allows users to change module versions granularly across environments, rather than changing a global value and updating all of your environments at once.

To ensure that we're using the same module as the envcommon module, we can reference the `source_base_url` value from the envcommon `include` block (which we'll learn more about in the next section), then specify the release version after `ref`. In the example below, we reference the `base_source_url` from our envcommon module, then override the version to `v0.47.0`.

```hcl title=/dev/us-east-1/dev/networking/vpc/terragrunt.hcl
terraform {
  source = "${include.envcommon.locals.source_base_url}?ref=v0.104.19"
}
```

## Including the envcommon module

Including an envcommon module requires using an [`include`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terragrunt-architecture-dry/#using-exposed-includes-to-override-common-configurations) block. This allows you to use or override any default values and reference locals in the envcommon module.

For example, this `include` block references an envcommon module in `_envcommon/networking/vpc-app.hcl`. We need to set `expose = true` in the block to allow referencing the `locals` block in the envcommon module.

```hcl title=/dev/us-east-1/dev/networking/vpc/terragrunt.hcl
include "envcommon" {
  path = "${dirname(find_in_parent_folders())}/_envcommon/networking/vpc-app.hcl"
  # We want to reference the variables from the included config in this configuration, so we expose it.
  expose = true
}
```

Note that we're using the built-in terragrunt function [`find_in_parent_folders()`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#find_in_parent_folders) to find the root directory of the repository, then specifying the path to the envcommon module from there.

## Specifying Dependencies

[Dependencies](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency) are a Terragrunt concept that allow you to specify that certain infrastructure-units must be applied before this infrastructure-unit. Dependencies can leveraged regardless of the source of the underlying module. This means that an infrastructure-unit that uses an envcommon module can reference dependencies the same way as an infrastructure-unit that does not use an envcommon module.

For example, say you needed to add a dependency block that specified a KMS key that is defined in the parent directory of the vpc, must exist before we can apply our example infrastructure-unit.

```hcl title=/dev/us-east-1/dev/networking/kms/terragrunt.hcl
dependency "kms" {
    config_path = "../kms"
}
```

## Using Locals

Like Dependencies, [Locals](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/locals/) are a Terragrunt concept that allow you to bind a name to an expression. Locals are a useful tool when leveraging the envcommon pattern to set environment specific values, like CIDR blocks, resource name prefixes, and more. An infrastructure-unit that uses an envcommon module can reference dependencies the same way as an infrastructure-unit that does not use an envcommon module.

Continuing our vpc-app example, we could specify the CIDR block in a local.

```hcl title=/dev/us-east-1/dev/networking/vpc/terragrunt.hcl
locals {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

## Overriding Inputs

Inputs allow you to pass in values to the underlying module specified in the `include` block. This is where the envcommon pattern shows it convenience and helps to keep your code clean and DRY.

Inputs specified in an input block are passed into the `include` block and override default values set in the underlying module. This allows you, a module consumer, to reduce the amount of code you need to use to leverage a module.

Continuing our VPC app module example, say there were 20 required input variables to the Terraform module, but across all of your environments, there were only two input variables that needed to be set.

Without envcommon, each time a consumer wanted to leverage your module, they'd need to specify all 20 input variables, increasing the likelihood of getting a value wrong.

With envcommon, you can specify reasonable defaults for all values, then module consumers can override the two environment specific input variables. Not only does this reduce the amount of code consumers have to enter, it encourages code re-use, and reduces the likelihood of a user inputting the incorrect value for an input variable. For example, you may have an organization wide standard that a VPC always have at least three private and public subnets. With the envcommon you can specify the three private and public subnets in envcommon, then allow the user to override the CIDR block input variable per environment.

Finishing out the vpc-app example, we override the CIDR block for an environment specific VPC by specifying the `cidr_block` input variable in the `inputs` block and provide the value we specified in the `locals` block.

```hcl title=/dev/us-east-1/dev/networking/vpc/terragrunt.hcl
inputs = {
  cidr_block = local.cidr_block
}
```
