# DevOps Components

Gruntwork DevOps Foundations is made up of a collection of _DevOps components._ A DevOps component is an essential element of modern infrastructure for which Gruntwork has pre-built IaC modules and pre-written documentation to reflect our recommended best practices and support fast setup.

## Available components

The Gruntwork DevOps components include:

1. **AWS Account Foundations.** Set up a best-practice multi-account setup, easily create new AWS accounts, and set secure account baselines.
1. **IaC Foundations.** Set up the foundational Terraform and Terragrunt coding patterns that your team can scale with
1. **CI/CD Foundations.** Roll out an infrastructure change in a way that meets the needs of your organization.
1. **Network Topology.** Protect your internal cloud resources from external access.
1. **Running apps.** Run your apps on EKS or ECS in a best-practices way.

## Working with components

Some components can be installed independently, and some components work best bundled together. In addition, some components depend on others being in place. In general, we have identified two "layers" of components:

### Layer 1

The first layer is the most foundational because all other infrastructure is built on top of it. It includes:

- AWS Account Foundations
- IaC foundations
- CI/CD Foundations
- Network Topology

### Layer 2

Once the layer-1 components are in place, the following components can be added:

- Running apps
