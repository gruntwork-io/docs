<h1>Why is the default behavior of embedded service module cloudwatch alarms &quot;treat missing data as missing&quot;?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AQc1V","number":537,"author":{"login":"umm0n"},"title":"Why is the default behavior of embedded service module cloudwatch alarms \"treat missing data as missing\"?","body":"\r\nWe use several of the Gruntworks modules in the service catalog, including redis. This means we also use the  cloudwatch alarms that come \"pre-packaged\" in this module. We noticed (after a brief outage during which we received no alarms) that the module is set to treat all missing data as missing, instead of breaching. We feel it makes sense for an alarm that monitors CPU usage, for instance, to treat missing data as breaching.
