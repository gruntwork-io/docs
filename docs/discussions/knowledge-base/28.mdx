<h1>Steps to migrate from traditional to multi account CloudTrail</h1>

As far as I know you added support for the AWS organization cloud trail to the `aws-security-module` in one of the last versions.\n\nIs there a migration path or documentation available which describes which steps are required to move from a traditional multi account cloud trail setup to organization trail with the Gruntwork module.\n\nThanks in advance and best regards","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\"><em>This message was extracted from a discussion that originally took place in Gruntwork Community Slack.

This should update the trail to be an Organization trail.
