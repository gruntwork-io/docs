<h1>How do I modify the for-production infrastructure-live example for a single-account setup? Do I need an accounts.hcl?</h1>

It feels weird both on a security side (but im a novice there) and also from a separation of code and data side.\n\nWhat are your recommendations?","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\"><em>This message was extracted from a discussion that originally took place in Gruntwork Community Slack.
