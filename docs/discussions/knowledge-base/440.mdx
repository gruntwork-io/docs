<h1>Reorganization of terraform/terragrunt code to make it more scalable</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84APrje","number":440,"author":{"login":"alvaro-ort"},"title":"Reorganization of terraform/terragrunt code to make it more scalable","body":"\nWe've created a terraform repo that deploys a Fargate based ECS with an ALB, VPM and routes. The main terraform folder contains 6 modules\r\n\r\nWe have the main file that allows us to deploy the `6 modules`. So with a simple `terraform apply` everything is deployed (around 35 resources). \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we have implemented terragrunt to keep things `DRY` between environments.\r\n\r\nThe main repo looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nterraform_modules/\r\n    cloudwatch/\r\n    ecs/\r\n    iam/\r\n    lb/\r\n    route53/\r\n    vpc/\r\n    main.tf\r\n    variables.tf\r\nenvironments/\r\n    dev/\r\n         terragrunt.hcl\r\n    staging/\r\n    production/\r\n````\r\n\r\nthe `terragrunt.hcl` file looks as follows:\r\n```\r\nterraform {\r\n  source = \"../..//terraform_modules/\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ninputs = {\r\n  AWS_REGION = get_env(\"AWS_REGION\")\r\n  AWS_ACCES_KEY = get_env(\"AWS_ACCESS_KEY\")\r\n  AWS_SECRET_KEY = get_env(\"AWS_SECRET_KEY\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMain questions:\r\n- From the book `Terraform up& running - O'Reilly` it looks like it's not good practice to deploy everything from a single command, since I'll be dealing with more than 35 resources at once. What would be the best recommendations? \r\n     - Should I deploy resources from the modules folder and create a readme with instruction on the modules deployment order?\r\n     - If so, should I replace from `variables` in each module to `data` ?\r\n- Terragrunt organization:\r\n     - from the documentation, it looks like i should refactor as well my single terragrunt to split it into multiple terragrunts. For my given config, should I do that?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n<ins datetime=\"2022-05-31T14:56:04Z\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://support.gruntwork.io/hc/requests/108682\">Tracked in ticket #108682</a></p>\n</ins>\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">We've created a terraform repo that deploys a Fargate based ECS with an ALB, VPM and routes.
