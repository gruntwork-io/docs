<h1>Ref Arch 2.0 vs Ref Arch 1.0</h1>

I thought it was really useful content, so added it here!\r\n\r\n> **Is there any documentation on all the infra changes between v1.0 and v2.0 for each module?**\r\n\r\nYes, we document the changes in every release of every module on its releases pages. For example, the releases page for the VPC repo is at https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/releases. You can go through the release notes between any two releases to see what changed.\r\n\r\n> **Is there anyway to manage these resources in v2.0 or do we have to create another module for those resources?**\r\n\r\nWith Ref Arch 2.0, if an existing service from the Service Catalog does what you want, you don't have to create any new module yourself; you can just deploy that service directly from a `terragrunt.hcl` file. However, if there is extra behaviour that you want, such as your example of adding additional `IAM roles` to the `EKS cluster`, you can do so by creating your own service which either extends a Gruntwork service, or a completely new one that combines various Gruntwork modules. The docs for both of these items are [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/core-concepts.md#do-it-with-the-gruntwork-service-catalog)\r\n\r\n> **How do you upgrade Ref Arch 1.0 and Ref Arch 2.0 to newer versions**\r\n\r\nIf you are using Ref Arch 2.0, built entirely on services from the Gruntwork Service Catalog, then you are effectively maintaining a single a repo, infrastructure-live, which just has `terragrunt.hcl` files. When a new version of Terraform comes out, we update all the modules in the Service Catalog to work with it, release a new version, and the only thing you need to do is update the version numbers in your `infrastructure-live` repo. However, with Ref Arch 1.0, you have not only an `infrastructure-live` repo, but also an `infrastructure-modules` repo with thousands of lines Terraform code in it. When a new version of Terraform comes out, you have to update all that Terraform code, test it, release new versions, and only then can you update your `infrastructure-live` repo. So the main advantage is not having to maintain/update thousands of lines of Terraform code.\r\n\r\n> **Other than the improvements in the IAC , does v2.0 have any other benefits compared to v1 in security or reliability?**\r\n\r\nThere are a number of improvements discussed in the blog post: https://blog.gruntwork.io/introducing-reference-architecture-2-0-4b773bbd005a. From a security perspective, for example, Landing Zone adds a lot of features, including, for example, AWS Config, end-to-end encryption, and more. Also, Gruntwork Pipelines is a more secure way to do CI / CD. Both are built into 2.0.\r\n\r\n> **Do you continue to support/maintain the v1 reference architecture code ( terraform modules) ?**\r\n\r\nAll the original modules are still supported, just as before. However, we no longer maintain the Acme examples that use those modules in a 1.0 configuration. Instead, we now maintain 2.0 Acme examples: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/master/examples/for-production.\r\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/brikis98/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/brikis98\">@brikis98</a> for the thorough answers to this support request.
