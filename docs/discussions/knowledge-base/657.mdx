<h1>How to configure renovate to scan gruntwork-io repos</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84ASZcu","number":657,"author":{"login":"nadiia-kotelnikova"},"title":"How to configure renovate to scan gruntwork-io repos","body":"\nHey, \r\n\r\ni am excited to use Patcher as soon as it is ready. But for now, i would like to configure Renovate and, unfortunately, cannot get it run. For me looks like renovate cannot scan private repos (most of our `infrastructure-live` modules point to `gruntwork-io` repos) although we have the subscription. \r\n\r\nIs there any workaround? Or is it correct that it cannot be achieved with renovate and `gruntwork-io` modules? I saw also this `\"registryUrls\": [\"https://registry.dogfood-dev.com\"]` registry, can I use it somehow? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\n\n---\n\n<ins datetime=\"2023-02-04T10:18:19Z\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://support.gruntwork.io/hc/requests/109867\">Tracked in ticket #109867</a></p>\n</ins>\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">Hey,</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">i am excited to use Patcher as soon as it is ready.
