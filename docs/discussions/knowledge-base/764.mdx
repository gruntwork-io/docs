As this requirement is rolled out, all users in these groups will receive emails regarding the change. If you have received one or more of these emails from GitHub and you do not have two-factor authentication configured by the specified deadline, your GitHub access will be restricted.\r\n\r\n### Benefits of two-factor authentication\r\n\r\nTwo-factor authentication provides a second layer of login protection beyond just a password, enforcing a robust defense-in-depth approach to authentication. There are multiple types of two-factor authentication, most of which involve entering a unique generated code to validate a login attempt. \r\n\r\nGitHub supports several two-factor authentication methods such as a security key, GitHub Mobile, authenticator app (TOTP) and text message, and recommends enabling at least two options. Having multiple options enabled is beneficial in the event you lose the ability to access to one of your second factors. If you lose access to all of your GitHub two-factor authentication methods, the only way to access your GitHub account is with your recovery codes (which get set up when you enable 2FA) so be sure to save these in a safe place!\r\n\r\n### How does this impact me?\r\n\r\nIf you haven’t received these emails, no action is required. If you have, then:\r\n\r\n- If you already have two-factor authentication enabled, these emails are purely informational and a reminder not to *disable* two-factor authentication.\r\n- If you *do not* have two-factor authentication enabled, enable it by the deadline specified in the emails, or your access to GitHub will be restricted.\r\n\r\n ### What about machine users?\r\n\r\nIf you are utilizing separate GitHub user accounts as machine users with Gruntwork, don’t forget to configure two-factor authentication on those accounts to avoid any disruptions to automated deployments. **We recommend enabling two-factor authentication for machine users proactively**, since emails to those accounts often go unnoticed.\r\n\r\nNote that enabling two-factor authentication for these users will not interfere with your automations, as neither the GitHub PAT nor SSH key usage require a second authentication factor. When setting up 2FA for machine users, we recommend using a shared password store for credentials and recovery codes, and/or adding multiple devices, so that access to the account isn’t restricted to a single team member.\r\n\r\n### Still have questions?\r\n\r\nFor additional information on how GitHub plans to roll this change out, please refer to the [official GitHub blog post announcement](https://github.blog/2023-03-09-raising-the-bar-for-software-security-github-2fa-begins-march-13).
