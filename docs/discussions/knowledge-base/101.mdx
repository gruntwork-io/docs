<h1>How can I migrate from a single-account to a multi-account Ref Arch in the future?</h1>

In general, we recommend purchasing a multi-account Reference Architecture and migrating your existing workloads there, as the amount of work to migrate the existing infrastructure is fairly significant. It is likely going to be cheaper and faster to migrate your workloads to a new fresh Reference Architecture than it is to adapt your existing one.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, my recommendation for adopting multi-account infrastructure is to start by creating the 3 supporting accounts (`security`, `logs`, and `shared`) using [the production example code](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/master/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live) as an example.\r\n\r\nOnce those accounts are setup, then you can create a new application account to act as your demo account that is hooked to those (e.g., having the `security` account as the gateway for IAM; having the `shared` account host docker images and AMIs; etc), and then migrate your demo workloads to there.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a successful demo workload, then you can repeat the step for `stage` and `prod` until you have everything migrated over.\r\n\r\nHowever, be apprised that this DIY approach is basically deploying the Gruntwork multi-account Ref Arch from scratch, and it is pretty involved with a lot of nuance, such as the deployment order, cross-account permissions, and resource-sharing configs.
