<h1>Help! Terraform Cloud have removed `python` from their worker image</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84APhB-","number":412,"author":{"login":"KOConchobhair"},"title":"Help! Terraform Cloud have removed `python` from their worker image","body":"\nI have been using Gruntwork modules in conjunction with Terraform Cloud for over a year.

As far as I can tell, there was no notice, no documentation or release notes on this - they just changed it without warning and now my deployment is completely blocked.
