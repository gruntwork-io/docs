<h1>Terratest for terraform-provider-megaport</h1>

My understanding is that we can use Terraform plan/apply features for testing with terratest but can't using megaport's api to run any custom tests. Can you advise if this is correct? \r\n\r\nThanks\n\n---\n\n<ins datetime=\"2023-10-20T05:51:46Z\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://support.gruntwork.io/hc/requests/110545\">Tracked in ticket #110545</a></p>\n</ins>\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">Hi team,</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">I'm wondering if Terratest works with Megaport Terraform Provider (terraform-provider-megaport).
