While the various VCS systems have some form of branch protection feature, these features are generally fairly limited in what you can limit.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, if you have advanced use cases with ACLs and CI/CD, it is best to break apart the code for each of the environment subsets into separate repos so that you only grant write access to the users that are allowed to freely deploy.\r\n\r\nNote that depending on the VCS system, you may be able to craft a branch protection rule that allows implementation of the flow you would like. For example, on GitHub, you can implement branch protection with `CODEOWNERS` such that you must have a PR to merge into `main`, and every PR requires an approval from a `CODEOWNER`. Then, you can implement code owner rules such that `prod` and `stage` have a different set of users who can approve the code to deploy.\r\n\r\nBe aware that even this has limitation, as you can't dynamically adjust the number of reviews that are required.
