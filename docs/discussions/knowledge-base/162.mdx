<h1>Multiple Account Switching via AWS Console</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AOqf0","number":162,"author":{"login":"wataruian"},"title":"Multiple Account Switching via AWS Console","body":"Hi Gruntwork team!\r\n\r\nI would like to ask a question regarding switching of accounts using AWS Console. Let’s say I logged in to AWS Console of `security` account using my IAM user and I want to switch to `stage` account and vice-versa. I can’t seem to it do it from there, but if I logged in from the `\"master\"` account I can switch to all accounts (dev, stage, prod, logs, security, shared) just fine. Is it possible to switch from a member account to another member account and vice-versa? If yes, what are the necessary permissions/steps in order to do so. Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"365\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-01-28 at 2 41 11 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32057659/151736265-3295a711-2239-4b87-8aab-fe1bf48057f4.png\">\r\n\r\nr:terraform-aws-security\r\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">Hi Gruntwork team!</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">I would like to ask a question regarding switching of accounts using AWS Console.

While I'm setting up this for my own accounts to be able to provide a bit more specific guidance, I believe the steps that will get you to what you want are:\r\n\r\n1.
