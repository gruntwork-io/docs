Please log into your root account and register your domains via Route53 there manually\r\n1. If this succeeds, you can then log into your Dev account and manually create the Route53 hosted zone with a name that exactly matches your Dev domain name, `example-dev.com`\r\n2. Take note of the NS/SOA records that are automatically created by AWS in your Hosted Zone. In your domain registration settings, update your domain to point to these NS/SOA records **IMPORTANT** - please be sure to update your Route 53 domain settings with the NS/SOA records that were auto-assigned in your Hosted Zone. _Don't_ do the inverse: updating your Hosted Zone to point at the NS/SOA records of your registered domain. \r\n3.
