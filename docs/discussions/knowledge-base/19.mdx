<h1>Provider error while trying to configure terragrunt in Atlantis CI</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"MDEwOkRpc2N1c3Npb24zNTQ5MjU3","number":19,"author":{"login":"gruntwork-support"},"title":"Provider error while trying to configure terragrunt in Atlantis CI","body":"_This message was extracted from a discussion that originally took place in Gruntwork Community Slack. Names and URLs have been removed where appropriate_\n\n**From a customer**\n\nGood morning. A basic question, sorry. I get errors using some of your account-baseline modules, due to an aws provider block embedded in the code that does not have any profile information. I assume the credentials should be taken from the root module (where the profile is defined) but it seems this doesn't happen. How would you expect me to pass the right credentials to that child module?\n\n```\n╷\n│ Error: error configuring Terraform AWS Provider: no valid credential sources for Terraform AWS Provider found.\n│\n│ Please see https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws\n│ for more information about providing credentials.\n│\n│ Error: NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain.

Provider configurations, unlike most other concepts in Terraform, are global to an entire Terraform configuration and can be shared across module boundaries.
