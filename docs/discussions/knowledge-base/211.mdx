<h1>Reference Architecture and AWS Service Quotas or Limits</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AO2tc","number":211,"author":{"login":"zackproser"},"title":"Reference Architecture and AWS Service Quotas or Limits","body":"A customer asked: \r\n> How do AWS service quotas (a.k.a Limits) factor into a Gruntwork Reference Architecture deployment? ","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">A customer asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">How do AWS service quotas (a.k.a Limits) factor into a Gruntwork Reference Architecture deployment?</p>\n</blockquote>","answer":{"body":"[AWS Service Quotas ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) are fine-grained \"caps\" that AWS places on certain resource usage.

For example, our CIS Reference Architecture deploys several lambda functions in your account that automatically clean up expired IAM certificates. \r\n\r\nIf a new AWS account's service quotas for concurrent lambda execution are throttled by a strict service quota, for example, one that pins concurrent executions to 50, then it may not be possible to `terragrunt apply` the relevant terragrunt configuration that creates a lambda requiring more than 50 concurrent executions. \r\n\r\nIn this scenario, Gruntwork needs to reach out to AWS on your behalf and request service quota increases for all relevant services that might be constrained or throttled in your account. \r\n\r\nIt's important to understand that Gruntwork has no control over when or how AWS applies service quotas to your account(s), and can only request quota increases on your behalf and then wait until the limits are raised before proceeding with a deployment.
