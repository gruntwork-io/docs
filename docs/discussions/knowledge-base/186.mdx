Also you'll need to update the `mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands` to include `plan` and `apply`. By default we only specify `validate`. If you then run `terragrunt plan -destroy` or `terragrunt apply -destroy`, those dependencies will be ignored and you should be able to complete the destroy.
