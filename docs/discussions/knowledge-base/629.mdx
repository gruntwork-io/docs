<h1>How do I enable deletion protection on resources with Terragrunt and infrastructure-live/Reference Architecture</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84ASGdQ","number":629,"author":{"login":"iangrunt"},"title":"How do I enable deletion protection on resources with Terragrunt and infrastructure-live/Reference Architecture","body":"\r\nI understand I can use things like [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) at the repo level, and [prevent_destroy](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy) at the Terraform resource level, but is there a Terragrunt mechanism that I can use at the module level? For example, a way to make sure `./*/*/networking/vpc*` and `./*/*/networking/vpc-mgmt*` can't be deleted, even when those changes have been checked into the main branch of the repo?  \r\n\r\nI am considering setting up Gruntwork Pipelines following this [Knowledge Base answer](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/knowledge-base/discussions/349) as well if there is a path there, but I'd like to know if there is a native Terragrunt way to do this. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<ins datetime=\"2023-01-10T23:12:06Z\">\r\n  <p><a href=\"https://support.gruntwork.io/hc/requests/109785\">Tracked in ticket #109785</a></p>\r\n</ins>\r\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">I understand I can use things like <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners\">CODEOWNERS</a> at the repo level, and <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy\" rel=\"nofollow\">prevent_destroy</a> at the Terraform resource level, but is there a Terragrunt mechanism that I can use at the module level?
