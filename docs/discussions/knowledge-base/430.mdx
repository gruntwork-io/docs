<h1>Expire an openvpn-admin client certificate sooner</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84APn2Q","number":430,"author":{"login":"rhoboat"},"title":"Expire an openvpn-admin client certificate sooner","body":"\nI noticed that the VPN client certs returned by openvpn-admin are good for 10 years. We would like to be able to grant access to a specific environment for a much shorter time period, like days or weeks. I don’t see an option to specify an expiration date when generating a client cert.  Is the any way to accomplish this with the existing tools?\n\n---\n\n<ins datetime=\"2022-05-24T12:46:09Z\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://support.gruntwork.io/hc/requests/108654\">Tracked in ticket #108654</a></p>\n</ins>\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">I noticed that the VPN client certs returned by openvpn-admin are good for 10 years.
