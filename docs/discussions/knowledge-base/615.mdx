<h1>Need help debugging a failed gruntworks-pipeline</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84ARwgv","number":615,"author":{"login":"umm0n"},"title":"Need help debugging a failed gruntworks-pipeline","body":"\nHello! Some context: We're using the Gruntworks ref arq and the Gruntworks pipeline, in GHA.\r\n\r\nWe recently tried to delete our openvpn module and all its dependencies. To do so, we created a big PR that:\r\n- Deletes the entire openvpn directory in .../networking/openvpn\r\n- Deletes all dependency blocks that refer to this module across our entire repo\r\n- Deletes all calls to the dependency block outputs\r\n\r\nUpon creating the PR, the plan ran okay. All the Openvpn resources were flagged for deletion. \r\n\r\nHowever, when running the deploy itself, it fails with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe following modules were deleted:\r\n<EDITED>/networking/openvpn-server\r\nRunning apply  on each deleted module.\r\nDestroying <EDITED>/networking/openvpn-server\r\nAssuming role arn:aws:iam::************:role/allow-auto-deploy-from-other-accounts. These creds will expire after 3600 seconds.\r\nSuccess!\r\nRunning infrastructure-deployer with args: --aws-region ****** -- terraform-applier infrastructure-deploy-script --ref master --binary terragrunt --command apply --command-args -destroy --deploy-path <EDITED>/networking/openvpn-server --repo https://github.com/*******--force-https true --apply-ref-for-destroy HEAD^\r\nlevel=info msg=\"Successfully invoked Lambda function ecs-deploy-runner-invoker to trigger deployment.\"\r\ntime=\"2022-12-12T19:15:39Z\" level=info msg=\"Waiting for ECS task arn:aws:ecs:*****:***********:task/ecs-deploy-runner/************** to start\"\r\nlevel=info msg=\"Deployment ECS Task arn:aws:ecs:*****:***********:task/ecs-deploy-runner/**************  has started.
