<h1>Can you have multiple terragrunt.hcl files at the same level?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AP9A6","number":488,"author":{"login":"jamesosbourn"},"title":"Can you have multiple terragrunt.hcl files at the same level?","body":"\nI have been working on similar structures for Terraform code for a few years and only recently came across Terragrunt.  Certainly looks like it makes things easier and shortens some of the command line length with all of the required var inputs etc.\r\n\r\nOne question that I have is around the break down of code. Take for example a project in an AWS account/region and I want to create multiple VPC, or subnets or any other resource.  I have my module in another location and in my repo I basically have the unique values that I pass as variables when calling the module.  How this is defined is through multiple Terraform files files, one for each resources, e.g. vpc1.tfvars, vpc2.tfvars etc. I can update one or execute against all of them.  With Terragrunt it looks like I have to create the additional abstraction of putting each of these into another sub-directory each with its own terragrunt.hcl file to source the module and provide the inputs.\r\n\r\nWould this be a fair assumption?  It seemed like unnecessary overhead to me when you could achieve the same at the file level.  It separate directory or file would also require the duplication of the source reference for the VPC module unless you can link this into a shared location somehow.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I am understanding things correctly?\n\n---\n\n<ins datetime=\"2022-06-29T15:36:53Z\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://support.gruntwork.io/hc/requests/108856\">Tracked in ticket #108856</a></p>\n</ins>\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">I have been working on similar structures for Terraform code for a few years and only recently came across Terragrunt.
