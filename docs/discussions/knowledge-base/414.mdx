<h1>How should I setup OpenVPN for multiple regions in the reference architecture?</h1>

In this setup, the `mgmt` VPC is configured with a one way peering connection into each of the `app` VPCs (see [this diagram](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/45ac939c7e1db13491a171dd65c0048f283e810dc72cf0da56cec8a09725d817/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4b43304f4b5a4c2e706e67)). This allows the `mgmt` VPC to connect to resources in the `app` VPC, without having a direct network route between the `app` VPCs to each other.\r\n\r\nThe steps to do this in the Reference Architecture are:\r\n\r\n1. Decide on a primary region where the `mgmt` VPC will be deployed. \r\n2. Deploy the `mgmt` VPC using the [vpc-mgmt module](https://docs.gruntwork.io/reference/services/networking/management-vpc). You can also reuse the existing one from the Reference Architecture if you can tolerate the network connectivity from the ECS Deploy Runner to your private resources.\r\n3. Setup the peering connection.\r\n    - If the `app` VPC is in the same region as the `mgmt` VPC, you can use the variables in the [vpc module](https://docs.gruntwork.io/reference/services/networking/virtual-private-cloud-vpc) to configure the peering connection.\r\n    - For the `app` VPC in the alternative region, you will want to use the [vpc-peering-cross-accounts-requester](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/master/modules/vpc-peering-cross-accounts-requester) and [vpc-peering-cross-accounts-accepter](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/master/modules/vpc-peering-cross-accounts-accepter) modules directly. You want to deploy the requester in the `mgmt` VPC region, while the accepter should be deployed in the `app` VPC region.\r\n4. Deploy the OpenVPN server in the mgmt VPC.\r\n5. Update all the NACL and security group rules to accept connections from the OpenVPN server CIDR block.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this, you should have VPN access to both `app` VPCs via the single OpenVPN server in the `mgmt` VPC, made possible by the peering connection.","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">If you are adding a 2nd region, then it is recommended to deploy a <code class=\"notranslate\">mgmt</code> VPC to act as the network gateway for the additional VPCs.
