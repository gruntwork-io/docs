<h1>Resolving dependencies from multiple merges</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84APcSm","number":401,"author":{"login":"pete0emerson"},"title":"Resolving dependencies from multiple merges","body":"\r\nWe're just starting out with Terragrunt.\r\n\r\nWe merged in a depending module before the dependency had finished deploying. Now, all builds are failing because A didn't get created (not 100% sure why), but B's dependencies aren't met.\r\n\r\nAm I right in thinking that dependencies must be live before depending modules can be merged in? How do I fix a situation where neither the depending NOR the dependency are live, thus causing all builds to fail?\r\n\r\nI tried deleting the depending module from the S3 bucket, but that didn't seem to make a difference. I have also tried pushing directly to main instead of doing a PR, but that didn't do anything either.\r\n\r\nClarification note:\r\n\r\nI don't have a circular dependency in the traditional sense. I tried to create a resource, and before it had fully come up, I merged in another resource addition, which then failed to start. A does not depend on B, simply put. A didn't exist which the CircleCI build for B was running, so B failed it's build, but was merged in. A failed to start at all, so now we're stuck.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<ins datetime=\"2022-05-02T18:16:43Z\">\r\n  <p><a href=\"https://gruntwork.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/108534\">Tracked in ticket #108534</a></p>\r\n</ins>\r\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">We're just starting out with Terragrunt.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">We merged in a depending module before the dependency had finished deploying.
