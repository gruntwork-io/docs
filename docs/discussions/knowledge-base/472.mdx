<h1>Automatically create s3 backend?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AP1WB","number":472,"author":{"login":"jmreicha"},"title":"Automatically create s3 backend?","body":"\nI am running into an issue when attempting to start a new environment from scratch, which requires a new remote state backend to be created.\r\n\r\nThe problem only appears when I do a `run-all` from a directory that has dependencies. I have tested and get prompted to create the remote state if I do a `run-all` from a directory that has no dependencies and get prompted with `Remote state S3 bucket foo does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n)`\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see there is some discrepancy in how dependencies are treated, but my goal would be to be able to do a `run-all` and spin up everything in one shot with no manual intervention. Any guidance here?\n\n---\n\n<ins datetime=\"2022-06-16T14:01:47Z\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://support.gruntwork.io/hc/requests/108788\">Tracked in ticket #108788</a></p>\n</ins>\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">I am running into an issue when attempting to start a new environment from scratch, which requires a new remote state backend to be created.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The problem only appears when I do a <code class=\"notranslate\">run-all</code> from a directory that has dependencies.
