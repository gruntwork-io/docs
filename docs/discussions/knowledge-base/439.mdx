We use the AWS SDK to handle the authentication, so the signature method itself is unlikely to be an issue.

Depending on your method, make sure the environment variables or configuration file don't have extra or missing characters in the values. The most common issue is leading or trailing spaces, which the SDK is sensitive to.\r\n- Do you have clock skew? The signature is calculated based on time, so if your hardware clock drifts from AWS servers, that can mess up the signature algorithm. Make sure the hardware clock of your system matches the world clock down to the second (e.g., [this one](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/)).","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">This is most likely an issue with the AWS Credentials that you provided to the openvpn-admin utility.
