Depending on your method, make sure the environment variables or configuration file don't have extra or missing characters in the values. The most common issue is leading or trailing spaces, which the SDK is sensitive to.\r\n- Do you have clock skew? The signature is calculated based on time, so if your hardware clock drifts from AWS servers, that can mess up the signature algorithm.
