When talking about the [CIS Service Catalog](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-cis-service-catalog/), that is a wrapper around the [non-CIS Service Catalog](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/), which in turn brings together modules from our [IaC Library](https://docs.gruntwork.io/library/reference/).\r\n\r\nIn some cases, variables may be exposed at the lowest module level but not propagated up to the Service Catalog (and therefore not up to the CIS Service Catalog). In those cases, the variables would need to be propagated up the chain.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, variables may not be exposed at all at the lowest module level. In those cases, the variable would need to be added at all levels (module, Service Catalog, CIS Service Catalog).\r\n\r\nIn most cases, we'll review your PRs, make sure that it passes our standards (tests, et cetera), and then merge them in and release.\r\n\r\n## Feature Request\r\n\r\nYou can ask us to do this. We'll put it into our queue and triage it and then, if we decide that it merits inclusion in our code base, we'll build it out, issue pull requests, approve, merge, and release. We do not strive to include every single variable for every single resource in our modules. But we also want to suit the needs of our customers, so we'll usually help you out.\r\n\r\n## Fork the repo(s)\r\n\r\nYou can fork the repo(s) (at any or all levels) and make your own changes.\r\n\r\n## Write your own module\r\n\r\nYou could also write your own module or directly put the resources you need in your code base, with the features you need.\r\n\r\n## Comparing the options\r\n\r\nForking may seem like the fastest way to get this done. Indeed, if you need this yesterday, it may be. But now your code base drifts away from ours, and you won't be able to take advantage of our updates as easily. You'd need to manage the differences between our code and yours.\r\n\r\nWriting your own module faces the same problems as forking; you'll need to maintain it.\r\n\r\nIssuing a PR is the second fastest method, and as long as your PRs get merged, then the beauty is that we continue to maintain the code base moving forward, and you don't have to point your code base at your forks. You will have to update your code base to point at the newest version of the repo.\r\n\r\n# Your specific case\r\n\r\n## `retention_in_days` for the `aws_cloudwatch_log_group` resource\r\n\r\n1. `retention_in_days` is not exposed in the CIS Service Catalog.\r\n1. `retention_in_days` is not exposed in the non-CIS Service Catalog.\r\n1. `retention_in_days` _is_ exposed [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc/blob/17e71779b8f04d6e6b6a3e92ba4157d96f85cd83/modules/vpc-flow-logs/main.tf#L59) in the `vpc-flow-logs` module in the `terraform-aws-vpc` repository. It is configured by the `cloudwatch_log_retention` variable.\r\n\r\nThis variable would need to be plumbed up to the non-CIS Service Catalog and passed on to the CIS Service Catalog.\r\n\r\n## `max_aggregation_interval` for the `aws_flow_log` resource\r\n\r\n1. `max_aggregation_interval` is not exposed in either Service Catalog, and it is also not exposed in the `vpc-flow-logs` module in the `terraform-aws-vpc` repository. It is an [optional parameter](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/flow_log#max_aggregation_interval) for the `aws_flow_log` resource, we're just not currently leveraging it.\r\n\r\nThis variable would need to be added to in all three places (terraform-aws-vpc/modules/vpc-flow-logs, non-CIS Service Catalog, and CIS Service Catalog).\r\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">I'll address the question generally, and then dive into this specific example.</p>\n<h1 dir=\"auto\">Options</h1>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Pull Requests</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">First, we appreciate PRs.
