\r\n\r\n> To implement this, what I guess we need to make change in common.hcl file.\r\n\r\nYes, CIDR blocks are managed by default in `common.hcl` You can find an example [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/common.hcl#L59-L73)\r\n\r\n>  But how we are going to make this change in reference architecture ?\r\n\r\nIf a VPC has already been created, you cannot change its CIDR block. This is an [AWS limitation](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/vpc-ip-address-range/) and has nothing to do with our modules. So if they change the values in `common.hcl` and run `terraform/terragrunt apply`, it won’t do what they want! So there are really two paths:\r\n* Extend the CIDR block of the existing VPC. We don’t natively support this within our vpc-app module. However, a customer can [extend the module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/core-concepts.md#extend-gruntwork-services) and add the additional CIDR block from “outside” the module via the [aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association) resource.\r\n* Recreate the existing VPC. To do this, the customer would first need to run destroy on everything deployed into that VPC: every EC2 instance, RDS DB, ECS Task, etc. After that, you can run destroy on the old VPC, change the CIDR block, and run apply. I think the destroy/recreate will also happen automatically if you change cidr_block and run apply, but you can potentially face some issues with this. \r\n\r\n> Do we need to run gruntwork cli wizard?\r\n\r\nNo. You do not need to run gruntwork CLI wizard for this change. \r\n\r\n> What are the step we need to take, to make this change?\r\n\r\nExplained the overall approach above. You would have to make changes in the `commonh.hcl` file and run `terragrunt/terraform apply`.\r\n\r\n> Is there any impact on current / existing ref arch setup. ?\r\n\r\nExplained in one of the previous question. It would destroy the entire ref arch setup and try to recreate it.\r\n\r\n> We also have reserve pool of IP addresses, how do we extent CIDR ranges, please suggest.\r\n\r\nYou can extend an existing vpc module to provide support for this. Here is the [instruction of extending an existing module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/core-concepts.md#extend-gruntwork-services). \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAside from the questions you raised, here are additional questions/thoughts that would be worth thinking about: \r\n* We recommend using private CIDR blocks from [RFC 1918](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-your-vpc.html#vpc-sizing-ipv4). Why do you want to change the IP addresses from private to public? \r\n* We believe you are not allowed to have number greater than 255 in your IP address. Is `11.260.0.0/16` a typo? \r\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">Hey <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/ivishalvarshney/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/ivishalvarshney\">@ivishalvarshney</a>, we've discussed about these questions internally and here are the responses to your questions above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To implement this, what I guess we need to make change in common.hcl file.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Yes, CIDR blocks are managed by default in <code class=\"notranslate\">common.hcl</code> You can find an example <a href=\"https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/common.hcl#L59-L73\">here</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">But how we are going to make this change in reference architecture ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">If a VPC has already been created, you cannot change its CIDR block.
