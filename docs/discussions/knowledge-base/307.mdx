<h1>How much does it cost to run the Gruntwork Reference Architecture in AWS per month?</h1>

In our analysis, some of the heavy hitters in terms of adding costs to your overall bill are: RDS, ElastiCache, the Recording functionality in AWS Config, App clusters and services, and NAT gateways. You can start by examining these resources and seeing if you could re-configure, downsize or delete any of these resources. \r\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">The cost depends on the number of environments you configure, which infra you pick (e.g., EKS vs EKS Fargate) and a bunch of other factors.
