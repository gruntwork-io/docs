<h1>Issues when destroying modules via the gruntworks pipeline</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AS7Ph","number":682,"author":{"login":"umm0n"},"title":"Issues when destroying modules via the gruntworks pipeline","body":"\r\nWe're using the Gruntworks Ref arch, and the Gruntworks pipeline (and associated scripts) for deploying our infra, with GHA.\r\n\r\nWe encounter this issue only when attempting to delete modules, and only under specific circumstances. To reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. We delete a bunch of modules, create a PR and push our changes.\r\n2. The pipeline runs a destroy plan on each deleted module.\r\n3. We merge the PR and the pipeline begins to run destroy on each deleted directory, as shown here:\r\n```\r\nThe following modules were deleted:\r\n<redacted>\r\nRunning apply  on each deleted module.\r\nDestroying <redacted>\r\n```\r\n\r\n5.
