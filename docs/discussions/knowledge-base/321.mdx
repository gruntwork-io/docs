<h1>Setting up OpenVPN in new Env</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84APHLb","number":321,"author":{"login":"charan-digitaltrust"},"title":"Setting up OpenVPN in new Env","body":"Hi all,\r\nI have created a brand new Env and was able to bring up all the AWS resources using the Terragrunt scripts that we have except for the OpenVPN. We are no longer subscribers of Gruntworks and so we rely on modules hosted locally in our bitbucket. \r\n\r\nWhen I am executing the `terragrunt apply` on the OpenVPN `terrgrunt.hcl` file, I am seeing the error below. \r\n```\r\nError: Expected to find a Root Device name for AMI (ami-062b821853cfec0ee), but got none\r\n\r\n  on .terraform/modules/openvpn/modules/openvpn-server/main.tf line 40, in resource \"aws_launch_configuration\" \"openvpn\":\r\n  40: resource \"aws_launch_configuration\" \"openvpn\" {\r\n```\r\n  \r\n From a little bit of exploring, it looks like it depends on the packer (`openvpn-server.json`) file. However, it requires the github token in order to pull the gruntworks cli tools.
