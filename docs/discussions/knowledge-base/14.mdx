Names and URLs have been removed where appropriate_\n\n**From a customer**\n\nThis is kind of an abstract, strategy question but here goes. With our refarch, we have a number of DRY violations (in particular, `ecs-deploy-runner` s in each account). Is it generally advisable to identify these things, then introduce a higher-level module (i.e. by wrapping the Gruntwork one) with all the commonality to reduce the size of the leaf `terragrunt.hcl` files?\n\n\n\n\nSo with the `ecs-deploy-runner` example, you might end up with a `my-ecs-deploy-runner` module which wraps it and then the `terragrunt.hcl` file in each account is just the vars that are different (e.g. the vpc id)","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\"><em>This message was extracted from a discussion that originally took place in Gruntwork Community Slack.
