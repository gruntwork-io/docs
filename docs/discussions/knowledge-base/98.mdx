<h1>How opinionated are we about deploying elasticache redis into kubernetes?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AORiM","number":98,"author":{"login":"rhoboat"},"title":"How opinionated are we about deploying elasticache redis into kubernetes?","body":"A customer was curious about how opinionated we are when deploying redis/elasticache into a kubernetes cluster in the Reference Architecture.","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">A customer was curious about how opinionated we are when deploying redis/elasticache into a kubernetes cluster in the Reference Architecture.</p>","answer":{"body":"Using a managed service wherever possible is our recommendation for data stores. It costs money, but it allows you to offload a huge amount of work on to a dedicated team of experts, including how to handle persistent disks, backup for disaster recovery, point in time snapshots, replication, sharding (for some data stores), monitoring, alerting, connectivity, security, upgrades, scalability, high availability, and much more.\r\n\r\nIf there is absolutely no way to use a managed service—e.g., you have a compliance requirement and the available managed services don’t meet those requirements—then you’ll have to run the data store yourself. So far, we’ve used VMs for this, and avoided Docker, but that’s something we may want to revisit, at least with K8S. From what I’m seeing, there are some good, off-the-shelf Helm charts fro various data stores—sometimes, created/maintained by the maintainers of the data store itself—that solve a lot of the hard problems for you. But I’m not 100% on this, and we should probably take some time to dig deeper, and see how well it works.\r\n\r\ncredit to @brikis98","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">Using a managed service wherever possible is our recommendation for data stores.
