This is tedious, especially if you are moving a folder in the middle of the tree, but it is much easier to guarantee the state files remain intact. To do this while keeping state, for each module do the following:\r\n\r\n- Dump out the state to a known, temporary location using `terragrunt state pull > $PATH_TO_TEMP_LOCATION` (where `PATH_TO_TEMP_LOCATION` is a file path, e.g. `/tmp/temporary_state.tfstate`).\r\n- Make the change to the filesystem, moving the module to the desired folder location.\r\n- In the new folder, import the state using `terragrunt state push $PATH_TO_TEMP_LOCATION`.\r\n- (Optional) Remove the state file from the old path in the remote state location using the AWS CLI or AWS web console.","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">The best way to do this is to move the state file using <code class=\"notranslate\">state pull</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">state push</code>, one module at a time.
