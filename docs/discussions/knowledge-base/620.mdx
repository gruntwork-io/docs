<h1>Reference Architecture: sample-app-frontend ecs - how to change desired number of tasks?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84ARz8P","number":620,"author":{"login":"drafie"},"title":"Reference Architecture: sample-app-frontend ecs - how to change desired number of tasks?","body":"\nI am following the Getting Started guide in our RA deployment and I am at 03-configure-gw-pipelines.md. \r\n\r\nThe guide says:\r\n\r\n> You can try out the pipeline by making a change to one of the modules.
