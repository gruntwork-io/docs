<h1>How do I manage cross account access with IAM Roles for Service Accounts?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AOpFx","number":156,"author":{"login":"yorinasub17"},"title":"How do I manage cross account access with IAM Roles for Service Accounts?","body":"I'm looking at how to provide access to an S3 bucket in our `shared` AWS account via IRSA from our EKS clusters in dev, stage, and prod. Any advice how to relate the role ARNs in the `infrastructure-live` repo between the accounts? Should I generate the roles in each account then manually enter the role's ARN into role policy documents? I'm not sure what the proper mechanism is to share data between the accounts like this.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I have an EKS pod in my prod account which needs access to an S3 bucket in the prod account, and a second S3 bucket in the shared account. I have a role in prod which is setup for IRSA and provides access to a S3 bucket in the prod account, how can I write the IAM policies in the shared account to preform a cross account s3 bucket access, via role chaining, in Terraform without manually copying ARNs and OIDC identifiers around?","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">I'm looking at how to provide access to an S3 bucket in our <code class=\"notranslate\">shared</code> AWS account via IRSA from our EKS clusters in dev, stage, and prod.
