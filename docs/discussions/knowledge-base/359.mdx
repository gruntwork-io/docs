<h1>SSH to private instances over OpenVPN network?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84APTQX","number":359,"author":{"login":"yorinasub17"},"title":"SSH to private instances over OpenVPN network?","body":"I've deployed the latest OpenVPN server using the `terraform-aws-service-catalog` production example. I can request and revoke certs, and connect with (non-revoked) certificates, and I can SSH to the private IP of the OpenVPN server and connect with my named user.\r\n\r\nI then deployed an EC2 instance to the private subnet of my app VPC, and tried to SSH to the instance using the private IP address of the instance (while connected to VPN), but I am getting a network timeout. I _can_ SSH into the EC2 instance if I use the OpenVPN server as a traditional bastion hop. The instance is configured with a security group rule to allow SSH access from the OpenVPN server (via a source security group rule, as opposed to CIDR block).\r\n\r\nHow can I directly SSH to instances over the OpenVPN network?","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">I've deployed the latest OpenVPN server using the <code class=\"notranslate\">terraform-aws-service-catalog</code> production example.
