<h1>EKS cluster managed workers: customize auto scaling group (ASG) name</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AOeI1","number":131,"author":{"login":"zackproser"},"title":"EKS cluster managed workers: customize auto scaling group (ASG) name","body":"A customer asked: \r\n> Good afternoon - we are currently using the [terraform-aws-eks/eks-cluster-managed-workers](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/blob/master/modules/eks-cluster-managed-workers) module. We use a launch template as well for our node group configuration. I am wondering if there is a way to customize the name of the ASG that it creates. It appears its using the same name as the launch template . I noted there is a name_prefix variable for this module, but wondering if that prefixes all resources including ASG?\r\n In the code it looks like it may be only used for EC2 resources\r\nactually the provider config for a worker node https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/eks_node_group doesn't even show where you could customize the asg name\r\n\r\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">A customer asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Good afternoon - we are currently using the <a href=\"https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/blob/master/modules/eks-cluster-managed-workers\">terraform-aws-eks/eks-cluster-managed-workers</a> module.
