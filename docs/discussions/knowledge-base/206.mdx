<h1>Ref Arch - CIS - what are acceptable CIDRs / IP address ranges for IPAllowList?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AOzu6","number":206,"author":{"login":"zackproser"},"title":"Ref Arch - CIS - what are acceptable CIDRs / IP address ranges for IPAllowList?","body":"A customer asked: \r\n> We purchased a CIS-compliant Reference Architecture, and now I'm not sure what I should fill in for the `IPAllowList` in the `reference-architecture-form.yml`.

You might enter the range for your corporate office or VPN, and several of your engineers' home IP addresses.\r\n\r\nYou can always add and remove CIDRs later as needed, but anyone whose IP range or specific IP address is not defined in this list won't initially be able to access your Ref Arch environment / resources.","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">Since you're using the CIS ref arch flavor, you need to ensure that you do not leave the default wide-open cidr of <a href=\"http://0.0.0.0/0\" rel=\"nofollow\">0.0.0.0/0</a>.
