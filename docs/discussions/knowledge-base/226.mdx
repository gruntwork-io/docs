Upgrade `terragrunt` to the latest version first, and make sure your configuration is compatible by running a `terragrunt run-all validate` and `terragrunt run-all plan`. Since `terragrunt` updates are mostly isolated to the `terragrunt` configuration, it is the least disruptive to your infrastructure to update `terragrunt`.\r\n1. Next, you will want to upgrade `terraform-aws-service-catalog` to the last version supported before the next `terraform` version bump. Note that you will want to pay attention to the release notes in each backward incompatible version bump as you upgrade (the `x` in `0.x.y`) to make sure you take care of all the migration settings to avoid recreating resources. If you are starting with terraform `0.12`, then this will be `v0.16.0` of the service catalog.\r\n2. Once you update to `v0.16.0`, you can start to upgrade the `terraform` version.\r\n    - You will want to update one minor terraform version at a time, all the way up to `1.0.x`. To update each module, first install the next minor version on your local machine, and then run `terragrunt run-all init && terragrunt run-all plan` to make sure no changes are being made. Once you verify no changes are made, run `terragrunt run-all apply` to commit the version update to the state.\r\n    - Note that when upgrading from 0.12 to 0.13, you will run into an issue with the provider versioning due to a change in how providers are labeled in the state file. To fix this, for each provider required by the module, run `terragrunt run-all state replace-provider -- -/PROVIDER_NAME hashicorp/PROVIDER_NAME` (e.g., for `aws`, the command is `terragrunt run-all state replace-provider -- -/aws hashicorp/aws`). **You will want to run this after the `terragrunt run-all init` call.**\r\n3. At this point, you should be on terraform `1.0.x` and the latest terragrunt version. You are now free to upgrade the service catalog as far up as you would like.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you are using the `ecs-deploy-runner`, you will also want to make sure the `deploy-runner` container is using the same versions of `terraform` and `terragrunt` as you are upgrading to.","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">In general, the strategy described in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"3652834\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/gruntwork-io/knowledge-base/discussions/43\" data-hovercard-type=\"discussion\" data-hovercard-url=\"/gruntwork-io/knowledge-base/discussions/43/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/orgs/gruntwork-io/discussions/43\">#43</a> is the best approach for managing an upgrade of <code class=\"notranslate\">terraform</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">terragrunt</code>.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">However, this is complicated by the introduction of upgrading the service catalog, which itself may have backward incompatibilities, especially when going from terraform version 0.12.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Given that, I recommend the following approach to updating the three together:</p>\n<ol dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Upgrade <code class=\"notranslate\">terragrunt</code> to the latest version first, and make sure your configuration is compatible by running a <code class=\"notranslate\">terragrunt run-all validate</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">terragrunt run-all plan</code>.
