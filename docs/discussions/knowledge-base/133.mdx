<h1>Gruntwork Pipelines: applying changes to common.hcl or other root files</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AOeJq","number":133,"author":{"login":"zackproser"},"title":"Gruntwork Pipelines: applying changes to common.hcl or other root files","body":"A customer asked: \r\n> Is it currently possible to have Gruntwork Pipelines apply changes made to the `common.hcl` file in the root of the Reference Architecture's infrastructure-live folder?  For example, we made some changes to our `ip_allow_list` to grant another engineer access to our bastion host, but after Gruntwork Pipelines ran successfully to completion without errors, we did not see the new IP address reflected in our bastion host's security group. \r\n\r\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">A customer asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Is it currently possible to have Gruntwork Pipelines apply changes made to the <code class=\"notranslate\">common.hcl</code> file in the root of the Reference Architecture's infrastructure-live folder?
