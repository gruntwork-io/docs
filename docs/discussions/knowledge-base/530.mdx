Most customers taking this approach either remove the security account, or keep it as a backup in case something fails in SSO and users are locked out of AWS.

However, the drawback is that it requires role chaining (SSO => security => child account), which has limitations on certain actions you can take on AWS, as well as limiting you to 1 hour sessions.
