Thanks for the question. Although the _Ref Arch_ is a completely separate new deployment (i.e. separate from the infrastructure you may already be running), there are a few things we can configure:\r\n- We can configure the [_mgmt VPC CIDR_](https://github.com/gruntwork-clients/infrastructure-live/blob/main/reference-architecture-form.yml#L107) for all accounts.\r\n- We can configure the [_app VPC CIDR_ ](https://github.com/gruntwork-clients/infrastructure-live/blob/main/reference-architecture-form.yml#L227)for app accounts (i.e. dev, stage and prod)\r\n\r\nNote that we could specify _IPAllowList_ in our Ref Arch _form_ that will control who has access to private resources via the Bastion host.\r\n\r\nI hope these tips could help you in the migration phase.
