<h1>Subject Alternative Names in existing certs?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AQEDQ","number":497,"author":{"login":"yorinasub17"},"title":"Subject Alternative Names in existing certs?","body":"\nI am using `acm-tls-certificate` module of `terraform-aws-load-balancer`.\r\n\r\nIf I try to add a subject alternative name to a cert that i imported into the module’s state, it seems to ignore it. I get the same plan output whether i have the `subject_alternative_names =` line or not.  If i add another cert description to the `acm_tls_certificates` input object, it seems to handle it properly and the SAN is visible in the plan output. Am I overlooking something? Or is the module ignoring the `subject_alternative_names` parameter when operating on an ACM cert that has been imported?\n\n---\n\n<ins datetime=\"2022-07-12T13:45:40Z\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://support.gruntwork.io/hc/requests/108958\">Tracked in ticket #108958</a></p>\n</ins>\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">I am using <code class=\"notranslate\">acm-tls-certificate</code> module of <code class=\"notranslate\">terraform-aws-load-balancer</code>.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">If I try to add a subject alternative name to a cert that i imported into the module’s state, it seems to ignore it.
