<h1>Subject Alternative Names in existing certs?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AQEDQ","number":497,"author":{"login":"yorinasub17"},"title":"Subject Alternative Names in existing certs?","body":"\nI am using `acm-tls-certificate` module of `terraform-aws-load-balancer`.\r\n\r\nIf I try to add a subject alternative name to a cert that i imported into the module’s state, it seems to ignore it. I get the same plan output whether i have the `subject_alternative_names =` line or not.  If i add another cert description to the `acm_tls_certificates` input object, it seems to handle it properly and the SAN is visible in the plan output. Am I overlooking something?
