<h1>EKS cluster exhausted all our private app subnet&apos;s IP addresses</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"MDEwOkRpc2N1c3Npb24zNTQxNzM0","number":12,"author":{"login":"gruntwork-support"},"title":"EKS cluster exhausted all our private app subnet's IP addresses","body":"_This message was extracted from a discussion that originally took place in Gruntwork Community Slack. Names and URLs have been removed where appropriate_\n\n**From a customer**\n\nHey Gruntwork folks! :wave:\n\nWe ran into a problem in our Dev environment today where our EKS cluster exhausted all our private app subnet's IP addresses. Fun!\n\nI was looking into this more and saw that our subnets (created with `vpc-app` module) are using a default prefix of `/21` giving them 2048 addresses each.\n\nOur CIDR uses `/16` which effectively allows for up to 65,536 total addresses, so we have some room to grow.\n\nMy question for you is how to accomplish this. I see that I can specify `private_app_subnet_cidr_blocks`, but I'd rather not have to manually calculate out each CIDR block to pass in to the module for every one of our VPCs. Is there a better way? Perhaps with the `subnet_spacing` vars and `subnet_bits` vars? I tinkered a little with that but was not really sure how to calculate the proper spacing given the desired bits that I gave it.","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\"><em>This message was extracted from a discussion that originally took place in Gruntwork Community Slack.

If you create new subnets and then allocate them to be used by EKS it will use them. (Can be a band-aid solution when you still have space on your VPC and cannot migrate to a bigger one).
