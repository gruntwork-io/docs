<h1>How the generate bock get parsed ?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AQMQq","number":518,"author":{"login":"nvanheuverzwijn"},"title":"How the generate bock get parsed ?","body":"\nHi,\r\n\r\nI have a fairly technical question about terragrunt. I am currently playing with it and I noticed a behavior that I am not sure if it is intended or not.\r\n\r\nSo I have this terragrunt file. I am not going to post it all, just the relevant part.\r\n```\r\nlocals {\r\n  project_id    = \"my-cool-project\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ngenerate \"main_providers\" {\r\n  path      = \"0001-providers.tf\"\r\n  if_exists = \"overwrite\"\r\n  contents  = <<EOF\r\nprovider \"google\" {\r\n  project = local.project_id\r\n}\r\nEOF\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen I use a file like that, I get this error :\r\n```\r\n│ Error: Reference to undeclared local value\r\n│\r\n│   on 0001-providers.tf line 3, in provider \"google\":\r\n│    3:   project = local.project_id\r\n│\r\n│ A local value with the name \"project_id\" has not been declared.\r\n```\r\nWhich make kind of sense, local.project_id does not exist yet when terragrunt parse it. However, if I change the offending line from `local.project_id` to `\"${local.project_id}\"`, the file correctly get generated using the local variable value.\r\n\r\nIs this an intended behavior and is it documented somewhere ?\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\n---\n\n<ins datetime=\"2022-07-25T17:19:56Z\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://support.gruntwork.io/hc/requests/109050\">Tracked in ticket #109050</a></p>\n</ins>\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">Hi,</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">I have a fairly technical question about terragrunt.
