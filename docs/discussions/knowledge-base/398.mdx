<h1>How do I access RDS database in the Reference Architecture from terraform machine?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84APaev","number":398,"author":{"login":"yorinasub17"},"title":"How do I access RDS database in the Reference Architecture from terraform machine?","body":"\nI'm trying to use the `postgresql` provider to provision a couple of database users onto every database that we deploy with the `rds` module from the service catalog.  It has to establish a client connection to the database to do this, and it's failing to connect to the RDS instances with a timeout.  Can anybody give me pointers on what I'll need to modify in our Gruntworks architecture (security groups?  network ACLs?  both?) to enable this?\n\n---\n\n<ins datetime=\"2022-04-28T14:33:44Z\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://gruntwork.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/108522\">Tracked in ticket #108522</a></p>\n</ins>\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">I'm trying to use the <code class=\"notranslate\">postgresql</code> provider to provision a couple of database users onto every database that we deploy with the <code class=\"notranslate\">rds</code> module from the service catalog.
