<h1>How do I update a Fargate service when I update the image using the same tag?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AO5v5","number":230,"author":{"login":"yorinasub17"},"title":"How do I update a Fargate service when I update the image using the same tag?","body":"We have a Fargate service that uses a docker image. We pushed a new image with the same tag and would like to restart the service to make it use the new image. Running `terragrunt apply` doesn't see any changes to the infrastructure, as there are none.","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">We have a Fargate service that uses a docker image.

When you stop a container, ECS or EKS will both spin up a new container to compensate.\r\n\r\nThere is no automated way to do this with `terragrunt`, or other declarative IaC tools (like `kubectl`) as they all depend on diffs in the configuration file itself to induce actions, and when you are updating the tag directly with new images, nothing will change in the IaC, and thus by design the IaC tools will not take any actions.\r\n\r\nThis is primarily why we recommend using specific tags for each image version, rather than relying on updating the same tag with new versions to induce rollout. Almost all of the container orchestration systems do not support automatically rotating images with the same tag to pull in the latest image, as they follow the pattern of immutable tags. In this scenario, rolling out new images is straightforward as you would update the IaC config with the new image tag, inducing a configuration change that will then get rolled out.","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">If you wish to rotate the containers in this scenario, the only option you have is to spin up a new set of replicas by doubling your replica count, and then tearing down the old replicas by spinning down the count.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Alternatively, you can do a manual rolling deploy by stopping each container, one at a time.
