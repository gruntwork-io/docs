<h1>ECS Deploy Runner permissions errors for new modules</h1>

The ECS Deploy Runner can be fitted to handle these new services but doesn't come with those permissions. One of the big features of the ECS Deploy Runner is [guarding against security threats](https://gruntwork.io/guides/automations/how-to-configure-a-production-grade-ci-cd-setup-for-apps-and-infrastructure-code/#threat_model_of_cicd), and therefore we don't recommend deploying it with wider permissions than necessary. \r\n\r\nHere, you'll have to add permissions specific to SES and APIGateway to the `deploy` and `read only` permissions of the ecs-deploy-runner.
