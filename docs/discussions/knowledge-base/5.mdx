<h1>In the Reference Architecture, why is there an ECS Deploy Runner in each account? Is this DRY?</h1>

During the Ref Arch deployment, performed by a Gruntwork engineer, the EDR is intentionally spun up in each account. Once up, it is the responsibility of the EDR to run `terragrunt  run-all apply` on that particular account's infrastructure-live folder (e.g., `dev`) in order to provision the resources defined in the scaffolded code. So, it's the EDR that is actually responsible for deploying the generated code that defined a Ref Arch\r\n2. Once the Ref Arch is handed off, the EDR intentionally remains in each account because it is what runs the CI/CD operations (running `terragrunt plan` when you push a feature branch, or `terragrunt apply` when you merge to main) and it is a core component of what makes our product unique. \r\n\r\n## EDR is concerned with locking down CI/CD operations for enhanced security\r\n\r\nIn a traditional infrastructure CI/CD setup, you are bound to give unlimited admin privileges to the CI server so that it can deploy arbitrary infrastructure. However, this has many risks, the primary one being a user with write access can open a PR that does malicious things in the CI pipeline by editing the CI config. For example, a user could modify one of the steps in `.circleci/config.yml` to run the command `env`, which would dump all environment variables to `stdout`. (However it appears that CircleCI is smart enough to obfuscate credentials which are defined as Environment Variables in the Project Settings.)\r\n\r\nTo protect against this, the `ecs-deploy-runner` employs a limited action model, where the AWS credentials provided to the CI server is only allowed to trigger specific actions, one of them being running `terraform apply` on the latest infra code.\r\n\r\n## DRYing up EDR configurations\r\n\r\nBy nature, the `ecs-deploy-runner` is a commodity in that there isn’t much difference between all the accounts. The biggest difference is actually in the `shared` account, where the `ecs-deploy-runner` is configured to also build docker images and AMIs. However, outside of that all the other app accounts have the exact same `ecs-deploy-runner` configuration.\r\n\r\nIn that regard, DRY-ing up the configurations that are currently nearly identical across accounts would reduce complexity by making it less likely to forget to update all the `ecs-deploy-runner`s.\r\n\r\nThat said, the challenge is DRY-ing up the configuration in a satisfactory way that doesn’t inadvertently introduce some other bug. \r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, we are really close to offering something better in the `imports` feature: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1566","bodyHTML":"<h2 dir=\"auto\">Having one ECS Deploy Runner in each account is intended</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The ECS Deploy Runner (EDR or <code class=\"notranslate\">ecs-deploy-runner</code>) actually has two purposes:</p>\n<ol dir=\"auto\">\n<li>During the Ref Arch deployment, performed by a Gruntwork engineer, the EDR is intentionally spun up in each account.
