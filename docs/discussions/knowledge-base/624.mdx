<h1>How do I incorporate a forward web proxy in the gruntwork RA</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AR8uj","number":624,"author":{"login":"hammondr"},"title":"How do I incorporate a forward web proxy in the gruntwork RA","body":"\nOur customers want to manage/block/allow outbound web traffic via squid (or similar) forward web proxy.  I can think of two primary ways to do this:\r\n1. Add a squid EC2 node as a _transparent forward/outbound proxy_\r\n- Add a squid EC2 node.  Use a persistent ENI, e.g. one provided by the [ASG server-group module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-asg/tree/main/modules/server-group)\r\n- update the relevant route table(s) to route 0.0.0.0 traffic to this ENI\r\n- add a route table for this node that routes 0.0.0.0 traffic to the RA NAT instance \r\n- no internal node/app configuration needed\r\n2.

Use a persistent ENI, e.g. one provided by the [ASG server-group module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-asg/tree/main/modules/server-group)\r\n- set the proxy URL environment vars `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` for _all the Linux Ec2 instances in the architecture_ to point to the squid interface/port\r\n- configure internal apps to use the same proxy URL\r\n- no route table work\r\n\r\nMethod 2 is easier to implement but is a \"weak/soft\" control on outbound web traffic.

About the `vpc_module` “fighting” this setup, you might have to disable some features in it and create some resources externally to the module, but it could work. For example, you could disable the creation of the internet gateway through the variable `var.create_igw` or some flags involved in the creation of the routes that could conflict with your intended setup.
