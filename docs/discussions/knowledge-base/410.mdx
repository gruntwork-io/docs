<h1>Persistent Volume</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84APftf","number":410,"author":{"login":"andrew-thyng-akido"},"title":"Persistent Volume","body":"\nHello, \r\nWe’re using the reference infrastructure here and I am a little bit lost regarding PersistentVolumes and where I would create one.\r\n\r\nWhen I create a k8s-service within our EKS cluster I am using the following block to create a PVC, which seems like it will work fine (I have only run `terragrunt plan` to check output).\r\n```\r\n  override_chart_inputs = {\r\n    persistentVolumes = {\r\n      somepvname-pv = {\r\n        mountPath = \"/var/data\"\r\n        claimName = \"myservice-pvc\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have the `aws-ebs` storage class installed \r\n\r\n```\r\nNAME            PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE\r\ngp2 (default)   kubernetes.io/aws-ebs   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  216d\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n1. Where do I actually make a `PersistentVolume` in my cluster?\r\n2. How do I either a) size my PVC manually or b) allow the PVC to size up automatically?\r\n\r\nI feel like I must be missing the place in the documentation this exists, so any help pointing that out would be great. Thanks!\n\n---\n\n<ins datetime=\"2022-05-09T16:20:57Z\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://support.gruntwork.io/hc/requests/108571\">Tracked in ticket #108571</a></p>\n</ins>\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">Hello,<br>\nWe’re using the reference infrastructure here and I am a little bit lost regarding PersistentVolumes and where I would create one.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">When I create a k8s-service within our EKS cluster I am using the following block to create a PVC, which seems like it will work fine (I have only run <code class=\"notranslate\">terragrunt plan</code> to check output).</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"  override_chart_inputs = {\n    persistentVolumes = {\n      somepvname-pv = {\n        mountPath = &quot;/var/data&quot;\n        claimName = &quot;myservice-pvc&quot;\n      }\n    }\n  }\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">  override_chart_inputs = {\n    persistentVolumes = {\n      somepvname-pv = {\n        mountPath = \"/var/data\"\n        claimName = \"myservice-pvc\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">We have the <code class=\"notranslate\">aws-ebs</code> storage class installed</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"NAME            PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE\ngp2 (default)   kubernetes.io/aws-ebs   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  216d\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">NAME            PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE\ngp2 (default)   kubernetes.io/aws-ebs   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  216d\n</code></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">My questions are:</p>\n<ol dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Where do I actually make a <code class=\"notranslate\">PersistentVolume</code> in my cluster?</li>\n<li>How do I either a) size my PVC manually or b) allow the PVC to size up automatically?</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"auto\">I feel like I must be missing the place in the documentation this exists, so any help pointing that out would be great.
