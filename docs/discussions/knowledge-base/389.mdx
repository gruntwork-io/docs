<h1>In the Reference Architecture, why is backend proxied from frontend?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84APWwo","number":389,"author":{"login":"yorinasub17"},"title":"In the Reference Architecture, why is backend proxied from frontend?","body":"I have few questions regarding reference architecture deployed - as I see, frontend and backend applications, represented as ECS tasks, are separated to the own target groups and own ALBs - so backend can be accessed directly only via frontend, and through frontend with /service/backend  route. This pass-through route is actually route, that belongs to the frontend application, rather than to the public ALB, where frontend sits in.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n1. Am I right, that traffic specifically for backend is being double-billed in fact (1st time - passed through public ALB, 2nd - through private ALB)?\r\n1. In case, if it’s needed to expose backend, let’s say for specific types of devices (like mobile cell phones), isn’t that more cost-effective solution to deploy an additional security group for backend, and configure a listener rule, to process specific path /backend  with that additional security group? Here meant, that this security group is attached to public ALB.\r\n1. Are there really any security concerns of such approach as listed on #2, in comparing with proxying requests with frontend application, if we’re speaking about CIS-compliance?","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">I have few questions regarding reference architecture deployed - as I see, frontend and backend applications, represented as ECS tasks, are separated to the own target groups and own ALBs - so backend can be accessed directly only via frontend, and through frontend with /service/backend  route.
