<h1>Seamless removal of resources through CI ?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AOmxN","number":148,"author":{"login":"rgarrigue"},"title":"Seamless removal of resources through CI ?","body":"Hi there\r\n\r\nTo create resources with our Gitlab CI we just add the folder/subfolder/terragrunt.hcl. During the MR phase, the pipeline will run-all plan, once merged it'll run-all apply, all good.\r\n\r\nBut how do we remove resources ? If we make a MR removing the folder, then nothing happens, the plan-all / run-all will juste ignore the folder/subfolder/terraform.tfstate (we're using the `key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\"\r\n` configuration) in our S3 remote state storage forever.\r\n\r\nSo far we could think of three ways\r\n- Merge all the .tfstate, to work like raw terraform would I guess, with a single global state. Not ideal, would defeat one of the point of using Terragrunt.\r\n- Remove it manually, the MR just reflecting the live state of the infra. We will do that for a while, but we'ld really like to avoid operators doing stuff on their workstations, so it's just temporary.\r\n- Add a `create_stuff = true` argument to our terraform modules, and the removal takes place in 2 MRs, first `create_stuff = false`, then remove the file. Maybe the best solution, but it'll requires some work, and that's one more argument to propagate between modules & submodules etc.\r\n\r\nI read the documentation but I saw no recommended way for this. Did I missed something like a \"compare my whole directory structure with the remote state bucket structure and destroy missing stuff\" command ? Or a recommended CI workflow ? Maybe a third party tool like Atlantis is relevant here ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any suggestions","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">Hi there</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To create resources with our Gitlab CI we just add the folder/subfolder/terragrunt.hcl.
