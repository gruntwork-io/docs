This is managed through packer at AMI build time. If you followed the steps in the guide, then the KMS key should already be accessible by the new account when you applied account-baseline in the shared account, so the last step is to update each of the build_*.sh scripts in the shared/REGION/_regional/amis folder to include the new account ID in the ami_account_ids list: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/shared/us-west-2/_regional/amis/build_bastion_host.sh#L28\r\n\r\nOnce the script is updated, you have two options for rolling this out:\r\n• Force packer to build a new version of the ami by updating the version_tag flag in each of the scripts, here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/shared/us-west-2/_regional/amis/build_bastion_host.sh#L76.
