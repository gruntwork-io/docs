<h1>Why does the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark package cost additional money?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AOFR1","number":69,"author":{"login":"marijakstrazdas"},"title":"Why does the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark package cost additional money?","body":"A customer asked: \r\n> Why does the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark package cost additional money?","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">A customer asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Why does the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark package cost additional money?</p>\n</blockquote>","answer":{"body":"Our reference architecture and the CIS compliance repo are certified by CIS.

As a result, for our customers, it’s following an upgrade guide, with mostly version number bumps, which can typically be done in ~1 day.\r\n\r\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">Our reference architecture and the CIS compliance repo are certified by CIS.
