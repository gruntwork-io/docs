<h1>Re-connecting to OpenVPN Instance after destroying and re-applying it</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AN3Mi","number":38,"author":{"login":"zackproser"},"title":"Re-connecting to OpenVPN Instance after destroying and re-applying it","body":"A customer asked: \r\n> Hello, we’re having an issue with our Openvpn server in our stage environment. Our environment was set up originally with the Gruntwork Reference Architecture.  We got a notice from AWS about a detected degradation of the underlying hardware hosting your Amazon EC2 instance. So we used Terraform to destroy the openvpn server module and then recreated it (I’m guessing this wasn’t the right way to do it). We use Viscocity to connect to the openvpn servers. I changed the IP for the existing connection to the new public IP for the new openvpn server but I cannot connect. Below is snippet from  my Viscocity log when trying to connect (certain information has been X’d out for security):\r\n```\r\n2021-10-15 14:29:29: Viscosity Mac 1.9.4 (1578)\r\n2021-10-15 14:29:29: Viscosity OpenVPN Engine Started\r\n2021-10-15 14:29:29: Running on macOS 11.6.0\r\n2021-10-15 14:29:29: ---------\r\n2021-10-15 14:29:29: State changed to Connecting\r\n2021-10-15 14:29:29: Checking reachability status of connection...\r\n2021-10-15 14:29:29: Connection is reachable.
