While our standard templates only support Slack, you can install additional/other integrations if the CI server supports it. For example, if you are using CircleCI, you can add https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/opub/ms-teams-orb into the `.circleci/config.yaml` to implement alerting to MS Teams.\r\n\r\n> Also, how do I perform a rollback when things fail?\r\n\r\nGruntwork Pipelines currently does not offer native support for a rollback. The primary reason for this is because Terraform doesn't really support a native rollback mechanism. The best way to roll back is to roll forward the deployment by pushing a revert commit using [git revert](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert).","bodyHTML":"<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">how can I set up other alerting mechanisms like an email via SNS or a Teams message?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Gruntwork Pipelines relies on the associated CI servers to handle alerting.
