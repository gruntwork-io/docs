Any thoughts or advice on this?\r\n\r\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">Hi everyone,<br>\nReading the documentation about module deployment, I was wondering if having a wrapper module (i.e., a module wrapping the reference to gruntwork infrastructure library) is a best practice even when we use terragrunt with a <code class=\"notranslate\">generate</code> section for both <code class=\"notranslate\">state</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">provider</code>.
