<h1>In the RefArch Gruntwork pipelines.yml, why are plan and deploy bundled in the same job?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84ASJFS","number":633,"author":{"login":"umm0n"},"title":"In the RefArch Gruntwork pipelines.yml, why are plan and deploy bundled in the same job?","body":"[r:terraform-aws-ci-pipeline-example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci-pipeline-example)\r\n\r\nThe Gruntworks pipe for the ref arch has plan and deploy steps bundled in the same job. This causes plan to be run when merging against master, even if it was ran moments ago when pushing the changes against the branch. For large plans, this creates a big overhead in terms of time. For example:\r\n\r\n1. Create PR, push changes. Pipeline runs plan, it takes 30min.\r\n2. Merge PR. Pipeline runs plan, it takes 30min. Then pipe runs deploy, takes another 30mins.\r\n\r\nWhy are we running plan again when merging? We already know the plan, it ran as a result of creating the PR in the first place. Wouldn't it make more sense to have these steps split into separate jobs? For longer plans, the time savings could be huge when merging.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<ins datetime=\"2023-01-13T18:46:46Z\">\r\n  <p><a href=\"https://support.gruntwork.io/hc/requests/109794\">Tracked in ticket #109794</a></p>\r\n</ins>\r\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\"><a href=\"https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci-pipeline-example\">r:terraform-aws-ci-pipeline-example</a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The Gruntworks pipe for the ref arch has plan and deploy steps bundled in the same job.
