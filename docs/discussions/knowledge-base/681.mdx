The main downside of not following this recommendation is the possibility that your apps might be unavailable if just one AZ fails, versus multiple AZs failing before your app becomes unavailable. The net effect of this change will be more AWS costs but also more resilience.\r\n\r\n### Gruntwork Reference Architecture Customers\r\n\r\nWe found a sub-optimal configuration in the default Reference Architecture where the `vpc-app` module set the `num_nat_gateways` variable to 1, even for a production environment. This should have been set to 3.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we recommend you update your reference architecture configuration prod environment to use multiple NAT Gateways for the `vpc-app`.\r\n\r\nTo update this configuration, modify the `num_nat_gateways` input in your Terragrunt configuration to deploy the desired number of NAT Gateways for your application VPC (at least 3 NAT Gateways, or 1-per AZ is recommended). The Gruntwork VPC Module will automatically distribute the requested number of NAT Gateways across available AZs and configure your private app subnet route tables accordingly. (Always test and validate any changes before deploying to production environments!) \r\n\r\nThe module itself does not have a bug. The mistake was deploying a Reference Architecture with the wrong value for `num_nat_gateways`. While we agree with Amazon’s recommendation and 1 NAT Gateway per AZ is a best practice, the main downside of not doing this is the possibility that your apps might be unavailable if just one of the AZs fails, versus multiple AZs. The net effect of this change will be more cost but also more resilience.\r\n\r\nFind the relevant application VPC Terragrunt configuration in the inputs block in `_envcommon/networking/vpc-app.hcl`.\r\n\r\nIf you also want to add additional NAT Gateways to your management VPC, find the relevant Terragrunt configuration in the inputs block in `_envcommon/mgmt/vpc-mgmt.hcl`.\r\n\r\nWe tested adding additional NAT Gateways and found that Terraform uses the ReplaceRoute API to update the route table rules. We found that there was no observable downtime or network interruptions while the route table rules were being updated. As AWS mentioned in the email, choose a maintenance window for architecture changes in your VPC. Always test and validate changes in lower environments before deploying to production. \r\n\r\n**Also see:**\r\n* [Gruntwork Docs: Making changes to your infrastructure: Terragrunt](https://docs.gruntwork.io/reference/services/intro/make-changes-to-your-infrastructure/#making-changes-to-terragrunt-code)\r\n* [Gruntwork Docs: `num_nat_gateways`](https://docs.gruntwork.io/reference/modules/terraform-aws-vpc/vpc-app/#num_nat_gateways)\r\n\r\n### Gruntwork VPC Module Users\r\n\r\nFor users who want to configure additional NAT Gateways in a VPC created with the Gruntwork VPC Module, specify the number of gateways you'd like to create with the `num_nat_gateways` input.
