<h1>How to deploy multiple containers on ECS?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"MDEwOkRpc2N1c3Npb24zNTU0ODk3","number":27,"author":{"login":"gruntwork-support"},"title":"How to deploy multiple containers on ECS?","body":"_This message was extracted from a discussion that originally took place in Gruntwork Community Slack. Names and URLs have been removed where appropriate_\n\n\n**From a customer**\n\nHi,\n\nFor deploying to AWS ECS, we are using `/modules/ecs-service-with-alb?ref=v0.10.1` with the container definition attached below. This works for our own application because our app runs in a single docker container. However, we are experimenting with a 3rd party application that runs with docker-compose (4-5 containers). How can we deploy such an application stack to AWS ECS? Do we need a different module? Or if we can use different task definitions with the same module?\n\nThanks.\n\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"${container_name}\",\n    \"image\": \"${image}:${version}\",\n    \"cpu\": ${cpu},\n    \"memory\": ${memory},\n    \"essential\": true,\n    \"portMappings\": ${port_mappings},\n    \"environment\": ${env_vars},\n    \"logConfiguration\": {\n      \"logDriver\": \"syslog\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"tag\": \"${container_name} ({{.ID}})\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n]\n```","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\"><em>This message was extracted from a discussion that originally took place in Gruntwork Community Slack.
