<h1>Adding a new account to RA - how to deploy the VPC when CIDR is required?</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AR5MJ","number":623,"author":{"login":"drafie"},"title":"Adding a new account to RA - how to deploy the VPC when CIDR is required?","body":"\r\nI am following the guide 06-adding-a-new-account.md and it is not in sync with the latest RA.   You can find the same documentation online here:  https://docs.gruntwork.io/guides/reference-architecture/example-usage-guide/adding-a-new-account/deploy-the-ecs-deploy-runner\r\n\r\nThe problem is that somewhere in this guide, a step seems to be missing relating to VPCs that are needed for mgmt and apps.  \r\n\r\nIf you follow the outdated guide - and attempt to deploy the ECS Deploy Runner - you will discover (among other things) that when you run terragrunt apply, you receive errors complaining about missing cidr_block variables.   If you trace those errors back - you find /common.hcl requires the new account's CIDRs for VPCs for MGMT and likely APP (mgmt_vpc_cidrs app_vpc_cidrs variables).  \r\n\r\nThe MGMT VPC is the very thing you are attempting to create so of course we don't have the CIDR values yet. \r\n\r\nSince the documentation is out of date, or at least not in sync with the RA that was deployed for us, I don't know if I missed a step somewhere earlier.   Are we supposed to use the gruntwork CLI to create these accounts if we are RA customers?   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<ins datetime=\"2022-12-24T06:13:58Z\">\r\n  <p><a href=\"https://support.gruntwork.io/hc/requests/109748\">Tracked in ticket #109748</a></p>\r\n</ins>\r\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">I am following the guide 06-adding-a-new-account.md and it is not in sync with the latest RA.
