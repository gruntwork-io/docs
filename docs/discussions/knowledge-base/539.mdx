<h1>Terratest as acceptance test framework in provider development</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84AQdfB","number":539,"author":{"login":"SoorajBharadwaj07"},"title":"Terratest as acceptance test framework in provider development","body":"\nHi Team,\r\n\r\nWe are in a process of developing terraform provider for one of our internal products and plan to publish the provider to terraform registry. We are using terraform's latest plugin framework and we do not find any acceptance framework available in it. So we are planning to use terratest as our acceptance test framework.\r\n Could you please let us know if there are any restrictions in using terratest as acceptance framework for the providers to be published in terraform registry? Also it would be very helpful if we could get references of any providers published in terraform registry using terratest as the acceptance framework.\r\n \r\n Thanks in advance,\r\nSooraj\n\n---\n\n<ins datetime=\"2022-08-18T15:14:02Z\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://support.gruntwork.io/hc/requests/109145\">Tracked in ticket #109145</a></p>\n</ins>\n","bodyHTML":"<p dir=\"auto\">Hi Team,</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">We are in a process of developing terraform provider for one of our internal products and plan to publish the provider to terraform registry.
