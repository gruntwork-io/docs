<h1>Help understanding how ecs-deploy-runners clones repos inside _envcommon</h1>
<GitHub discussion={{"id":"D_kwDOF8slf84APPrF","number":347,"author":{"login":"pete0emerson"},"title":"Help understanding how ecs-deploy-runners clones repos inside _envcommon","body":"I'm a little confused regarding the service catalog around the _[envcommon source](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/_envcommon/services/ecs-cluster.hcl#L15) cloning source repos\r\n\r\nWhen the ecs-deploy-runner is grabbing the source, how is it cloning the repo?\r\n\r\n`git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog.git//modules/services/ecs-cluster?ref=v0.82.0`\r\n\r\nThat makes me believe it's ssh just by looking at it...\r\n\r\nBut when looking at the [regional/container_images](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/shared/us-west-2/_regional/container_images/build_deploy_runner_image.sh) build process, it's only putting in a [GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/master/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/shared/us-west-2/_regional/container_images/build_deploy_runner_image.sh#L43) which means it's doing https cloning and I do remember there are parts where the code is forcing https clones instead of ssh clones.

So I'm just kinda spinning in circles a bit.\r\n\r\nThe reason why i'm bringing this up is because I made changes to instead of using a cloud based source repo, im using an internal only one. I got passed the host key adding with the ecs-deploy-runner and adding in our host key so it feels like it's trying to do ssh clones.
