<h1>Does gruntwork required aws root account to setup cloud infrastructure in an organisation</h1>

If we provides root access to any vendor or third party service it would be very high security concern. Or we need to create another root account for gruntworks and manage multiple aws root account. What do you suggest.?"}},{"node":{"author":{"login":"pete0emerson"},"body":"The command line tooling (source code [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork)) that we recommend that you use is used by you, with IAM user credentials that you provide it. You never turn those credentials over to us, they always remain in your full control.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to, you can analyze the CLI code to make sure that we're not doing anything sketchy. If this is still not acceptable to your company, then it is possible to [bootstrap manually](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork#bootstrap-manually) and then hand over the created AWS accounts (not the root account) to us to deploy into.\r\n\r\nA few notes, here:\r\n\r\n1) The CLI we provide to you (which only uses your root account to create the sub-accounts underneath) is the fastest and most reliable way to get your accounts ready for us to provision. We have seen over and over customer's missteps / mistakes / et cetera that ultimately slows things down and causes a lot of back and forth to try to sort things out. That's why we've created the CLI.\r\n\r\n2) If you create an IAM user, grant it Administrator Access, and then run the CLI, you can immediately revoke / roll the credentials afterwards. The window of opportunity for something nefarious to happen would be small. I suppose (to be the devil's advocate) that the CLI tooling could create a **new** user with administrator privileges to try to be evil, but now we're really playing cat and mouse! We do none of these things. **But my saying so may not be a strong enough requirement for your company.**\r\n\r\n3) Another alternative would be to create a new root account, as you suggest. This doesn't seem like a great option to me, but I'm on the outside looking in.\r\n\r\nI hate to make a real suggestion to you, because I don't know your company policies, but when I read this:\r\n\r\n> If we provides root access to any vendor or third party service it would be very high security concern.\r\n\r\nmy reaction is: you're **not** providing root access to us. However, you are providing root access to some tooling which was written by us. Is this acceptable? That's for you to decide."}}]}}} />
