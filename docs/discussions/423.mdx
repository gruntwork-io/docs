In this approach, you would replace the `security` account with the IdP that is hooked up to AWS SSO, and then link the Federated roles in each account to the IdP.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, the permissions for who has access to grant permissions to the different accounts are all handled within the IdP, so the strategy for limiting the permissions will be different depending on which platform you are using."}}]}}} />
