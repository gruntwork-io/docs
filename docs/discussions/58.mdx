"}},{"node":{"author":{"login":"rhoboat"},"body":"Unfortunately, we don't really have a full guide written about how to deploy the Reference Architecture from scratch. That said, for the most part deployment can be done by doing it in the following order:\r\n\r\n1. Deploy account-baseline of the logs account using terragrunt apply.\r\n1. Deploy account-baseline of the security and shared account using terragrunt apply.\r\n1. Optional if you want to deploy Gruntwork Pipelines:\r\n    1. Deploy ecr-repos in the shared account\r\n    1. Build and push the docker containers for ECS Deploy Runner: ecs-deploy-runner and kaniko\r\n1. Run terragrunt run-all apply in the logs, security, and shared folders.\r\n1. When you are ready to deploy the application accounts:\r\n    1. Deploy account-baseline for the account.\r\n    1. Create any EC2 keypairs that your architecture needs. This applies to any module that uses a non-empty string for key_pair_name.\r\n    1. Deploy everything else using terragrunt run-all apply in the application account folder.\r\n1. Once you are ready to migrate an application to a deployed Reference Architecture, you can follow https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/blob/c417871de44527e3b7cc1307757804df7e7c41a1/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/docs/03-deploy-apps.md.\r\n\r\ncredit to @yorinasub17"}}]}}} />
