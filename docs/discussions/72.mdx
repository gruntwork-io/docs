<h1>Does any kind of change to an EC2 auto-scaling group require a new AMI?</h1>

If you use alternative methods of setting up the app (e.g., using ansible to deploy the app on the server), then you risk having mismatched servers when an instance fails and is replaced by the ASG without the operator knowing.
