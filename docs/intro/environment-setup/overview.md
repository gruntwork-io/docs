# Overview

## [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

The AWS CLI is a powerful tool that lets perform most of the actions that you can do via the AWS Console.

## [AWS Vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault#installing)

AWS Vault is a slick tool that allows you to easily use different sets of AWS credentials to run commands (`aws`, `terragrunt`, `packer`, et cetera). Once you've gone beyond a single AWS account, a tool like AWS vault is immensely helpful.

## [Golang](https://go.dev/dl/)

Golang is an exciting language that has taken the DevOps / infrastructure world by storm. Terraform, Terragrunt, and Terratest are all written in Go.

## [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

If you need to control your Kubernetes cluster, `kubectl` is at the operational core.

## [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads)

Packer lets you build a variety of images, including AWS AMIs and Docker containers. Those images are defined via code for repeatability.

## [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)

Terraform's declarative nature describes your infrastructure as code. If you're using Gruntwork products, you're using Terraform.

## [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/install/)

Terragrunt is our layer on top of Terraform to enable a highly DRY code base.

## [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)

If you want to test your infrastructure, Terratest enables you to write those tests for manual testing or integration with a CI/CD pipeline.

## [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv#installation)

`tfenv` is a version manager for Terraform, similar to `pyenv` for Python.
