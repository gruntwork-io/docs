# Gruntwork Production Framework

The Gruntwork Production Framework is our opinionated, step-by-step framework for achieving a world-class DevOps setup. At Gruntwork, we've had the privilege to work with software teams from tiny startups to massive Fortune 50 companies to some of the world's largest government agencies, and this framework captures the common patterns we've seen that actually worked.
