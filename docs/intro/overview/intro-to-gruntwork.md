# Introduction to Gruntwork

### What is Gruntwork?

**Gruntwork is a "DevOps accelerator" designed to make it possible to achieve a world-class DevOps setup based completely on infrastructure-as-code in just a few days.**

The core elements of a world-class DevOps setup are described in the [Gruntwork Production Framework](gruntwork-production-framework). The [Gruntwork product suite](products) is designed to help software teams implement the Gruntwork Production Framework.

Gruntwork works best for teams building new infrastructure ("greenfield"), either from scratch or as part of a migration. It can also be useful for teams with existing infrastructure ("brownfield").

### Supported public clouds

Gruntwork products focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Support for other public clouds such as GCP and Azure may be added in the future.

### Gruntwork and Terraform

All Gruntwork products are built on and fully compatible with [open source Terraform](https://gruntwork.io). The one exception to this is the Gruntwork Reference Architecture, which uses Terragrunt to implement an end-to-end architecture.
