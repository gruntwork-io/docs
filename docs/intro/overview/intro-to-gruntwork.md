# Introduction to Gruntwork

### What is Gruntwork?

**Gruntwork is a "DevOps accelerator" designed to make it possible to achieve a world-class DevOps setup based completely on infrastructure-as-code in just a few days.**

All Gruntwork products exist within a framework we’ve devised specifically to emphasize DevOps industry best-practices and maximize your team’s efficiency. In the [how it works](how-it-works.md) section, we’ll cover how Gruntwork can help your team implement your infrastructure using this framework.

Gruntwork works best for teams building new infrastructure ("greenfield"), either from scratch or as part of a migration. However, it can also be used by teams with existing infrastructure ("brownfield") if they have sufficient DevOps experience.

### Supported public clouds

Gruntwork products focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Support for other public clouds such as GCP and Azure may be added in the future.

### Gruntwork uses Terraform

All Gruntwork products are built on and fully compatible with [open source Terraform](https://terraform.io). The one exception to this is the [Gruntwork Reference Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/), which uses [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) (one of our open source tools) to implement an end-to-end architecture.
