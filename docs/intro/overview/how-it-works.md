# How it works

## Overview

There are two fundamental ways to engage Gruntwork:

1. **Gruntwork builds your architecture.** We generate the [Reference Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/) based on your needs, deploy into your AWS accounts, and give you 100% of the code. Since you have all the code, you can extend, enhance, and customize the environment exactly according to your needs. The deploy process takes about one day.
2. **Build it yourself.** The Gruntwork IaC library empowers you to [construct your own bespoke architecture](/docs/guides/build-it-yourself/overview) in record time. By mix-and-matching our modules and services you can quickly define a custom architecture to suit your needs, all with the confidence of having world-class, battle-tested code running under the hood.

## What we provide

The Gruntwork product suite is designed to help you implement a world-class DevOps setup. It includes:
