# How it works

## Overview

There are two fundamental ways to engage Gruntwork:

1. **Gruntwork builds your architecture.** We generate the [Reference Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/) based on your needs, deploy into your AWS accounts, and give you 100% of the code. Since you have all the code, you can extend, enhance, and customize the environment exactly according to your needs. The deploy process takes about one day.
2. **Build it yourself.** The Gruntwork IaC library empowers you to [construct your own bespoke architecture](/docs/guides/build-it-yourself/overview) in record time. By mix-and-matching our modules and services you can quickly define a custom architecture to suit your needs, all with the confidence of having world-class, battle-tested code running under the hood.

## What we provide

The Gruntwork product suite is designed to help you implement a world-class DevOps setup. It includes a combination of products, services, and support.

### Gruntwork IaC Library

A battle-tested, production-grade _catalog_ of infrastructure code that contains the core "building blocks" of infrastructure:

- **[Landing Zone](https://gruntwork.io/landing-zone-for-aws/)** &mdash; See how you can use Gruntwork Landing Zone to [configure your AWS accounts](/docs/guides/build-it-yourself/landing-zone/intro/what-youll-learn-in-this-guide).
- **[Pipelines](https://gruntwork.io/pipelines/)** &mdash; See how you can use Gruntwork Pipelines to [set up a CI/CD pipeline for your IaC code](/docs/guides/build-it-yourself/pipelines/intro/what-youll-learn-in-this-guide).
- **Networking** &mdash; For instance, you can [deploy a production grade VPC](/docs/guides/build-it-yourself/vpc/intro/what-youll-learn-in-this-guide).
- **App Orchestration** &mdash; See how you can [deploy a production grade Kubernetes Cluster](/docs/guides/build-it-yourself/kubernetes-cluster/intro/what-youll-learn-in-this-guide).
- **Data Storage** &mdash; …
- **Security** &mdash; …
- [and more…](https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/#whats-in-the-library)
