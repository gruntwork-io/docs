# How it works

## Overview 
There are two fundamental ways to engage Gruntwork:
  1. **Gruntwork builds your architecture.** Lorem ipsum...Choose your AWS architecture preferences and we assemble it in about a day.
  2. **Build it yourself.** Using the same core building blocks, which we list below...

## What we provide

The Gruntwork product suite is designed to help you implement the world-class DevOps setup described in the [Gruntwork Production Framework](gruntwork-production-framework). It includes:

### Gruntwork IaC Library
