# Your developer platform is a product

You can think of your platform team as a _small startup_. Your _revenue_ comes from your budget. Your _expenses_ are your team members, plus whatever resources you consume like office space, cloud spend, or vendor tools.

You can think of your developer platform as a _product_ whose job is to balance the [three fundamental concerns](/2.0/way/why/overview):

- Products are built with an _ideal customer profile_ (ICP) in mind, and your ICP is your developer end-users.
- Products need to be _marketed_ to build awareness and drive adoption, and you need to teach your developers about your developer platform and make a compelling case on why to use it.
- Products have _competitive alternatives_, you compete most of all with developers who choose to do it themselves (DIY), and you need to highlight the clear advantages over DIY to end users.
- Products need _data_ to tell you about usage and friction points. You need insight into how your developer platform is being used and where it can be improved.

Finally, product teams _stay close to the customer_ through continual feedback sessions and always learning about what their customer needs. You'll need to do this, too.
