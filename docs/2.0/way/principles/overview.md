# Developer Platform Principles

We have discovered a set of guiding principles that collectively shape our approach to building developer platforms. We organize them into four categories:

## Core Philosophy

These principles shape the foundational mindset for building developer platforms:

- [Your developer platform is a product](/2.0/way/principles/core-philosophy/your-developer-platform-is-a-product)
- [The platform is a balancing act](/2.0/way/principles/core-philosophy/the-platform-is-a-balancing-act)

## Developer Experience

These principles focus on making developers productive and happy:

- [Pre-built patterns are your leverage](/2.0/way/principles/developer-experience/pre-built-patterns-are-your-leverage)
- [Enable developer self-service](/2.0/way/principles/developer-experience/enable-developer-self-service)
- [Make good practices the default](/2.0/way/principles/developer-experience/make-good-practices-the-default)
- [Shift left](/2.0/way/principles/developer-experience/shift-left)

## Technical Foundations

These principles establish the architectural patterns that make platforms reliable, scalable, and maintainable:

- [Build platform components](/2.0/way/principles/technical-foundations/build-platform-components)
- [Represent all patterns as code](/2.0/way/principles/technical-foundations/represent-all-patterns-as-code)
- [Define all live infrastructure as pattern instances](/2.0/way/principles/technical-foundations/define-all-live-infrastructure-as-pattern-instances)
- [Embrace immutable infrastructure](/2.0/way/principles/technical-foundations/embrace-immutable-infrastructure)
- [Use GitOps](/2.0/way/principles/technical-foundations/use-gitops)

## Governance & Maintainability

These principles address how to meet your governance and maintainability needs as the platform scales:

- [Guardrails over gates](/2.0/way/principles/governance-maintainability/guardrails-over-gates)
- [Offer "golden paths"](/2.0/way/principles/governance-maintainability/offer-golden-paths)
