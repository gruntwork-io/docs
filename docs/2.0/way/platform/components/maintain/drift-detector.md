# Drift Detector

**Detect drift between code and cloud**

Drift detection continuously monitors your infrastructure to identify when deployed resources no longer match their Infrastructure as Code definitions. This helps you maintain the integrity of your infrastructure as code practice.

## Why it matters

Drift happens inevitably as teams make manual changes, resources get modified outside IaC, or automation scripts run. Undetected drift means your IaC no longer represents reality, breaking reproducibility and creating hidden risks.

## What it enables

- Automated detection of infrastructure drift
- Alerts when drift occurs
- Reports showing what drifted and how
- Ability to reconcile drift automatically or manually
