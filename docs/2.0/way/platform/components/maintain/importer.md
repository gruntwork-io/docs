# Importer

**Import non-codified assets**

The importer takes infrastructure that exists in the cloud but isn't reflected in your IaC and generates the code to manage it. This helps you bring legacy or manually-created infrastructure under IaC management.

## Why it matters

Most organizations have infrastructure that predates their IaC adoption or was created outside normal processes. Without importing this infrastructure, you have blind spots in your infrastructure management.

## What it enables

- Discovery of unmanaged cloud resources
- Automated generation of IaC for existing resources
- Gradual migration to infrastructure as code
- Complete inventory of all cloud resources
