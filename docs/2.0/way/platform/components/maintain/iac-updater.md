# IaC Updater

**Update out-of-date IaC or tooling versions**

The IaC updater identifies infrastructure using outdated patterns or tool versions and helps you modernize it. This prevents technical debt from accumulating as your patterns and tools evolve.

## Why it matters

Infrastructure ages quickly. What was modern six months ago may now be outdated. Without systematic updates, your infrastructure estate becomes increasingly difficult to maintain.

## What it enables

- Identification of outdated infrastructure
- Automated or guided update processes
- Migration paths from old to new patterns
- Tracking update progress across your estate
