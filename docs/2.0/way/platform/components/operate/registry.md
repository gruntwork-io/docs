# Registry

**Where you see and manage what the business is running**

The registry maintains a comprehensive record of all infrastructure instances that have been deployed. It tracks the high-level entities that matter to your organization, not just individual cloud resources.

## Why it matters

A registry provides the source of truth for what infrastructure exists, who owns it, and how it relates to business objectives. This is essential for understanding your infrastructure estate at scale.

## What it enables

- Inventory of all infrastructure instances
- Mapping infrastructure to teams and services
- Tracking infrastructure lifecycle and ownership
- Integration point for other tools and systems
