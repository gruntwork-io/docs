# Pipelines

**How you deploy infrastructure changes**

Pipelines are the automated workflows that take infrastructure code and deploy it to your cloud environment. They include the checks, tests, and policies that ensure infrastructure meets your standards before deployment.

## Why it matters

Centralized pipelines enforce governance, provide audit trails, and ensure consistent deployment processes across all infrastructure changes.

## What it enables

- Automated deployment of infrastructure code
- Policy enforcement before deployment
- Testing and validation in pipeline
- Rollback capabilities when issues arise
- Audit trail of all infrastructure changes
