# Welcome!

The **Gruntwork Way** is Gruntwork's official framework for how to build a world-class developer platform.

## What's a developer platform?

Nearly every company on the planet needs software, and when companies write their own software with more than a few developers, the same common needs arise:

1. Enable developers to move fast ([velocity](/2.0/way/why/velocity))
2. ...while meeting the other needs of the business like security, cost, and compliance ([governance](/2.0/way/why/governance))
3. ...without accumulating an unsustainable level of debt ([maintainability](/2.0/way/why/maintainability))

A **developer platform** is the product your platform team builds to balance these three concerns. It consists of three essential building blocks:

- [Patterns](/2.0/way/platform/patterns/overview) - pre-built solutions to common infrastructure problems
- [Platform components](/2.0/way/platform/components/overview) - the machinery for deploying and managing infrastructure
- [Interfaces](/2.0/way/platform/interfaces/overview) - how developers interact with your platform.

Together, these enable developers to move fast while meeting the needs of the business, and to do so in a way that incurs manageable levels of debt.

## Why read this framework

Making sense of developer platforms can be confusing. We've found bits and pieces of insights scattered across blog posts, vendor solutions, and industry talks, but none of these presents a holistic way to think about developer platforms.

This framework will help you build comprehensive clarity.

Ultimately, that clarity will empower you to build a successful developer platform.
