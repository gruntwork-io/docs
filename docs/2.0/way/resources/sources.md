# Sources

In writing the Gruntwork Way, we drew heavily on our own internal experience and discussions. We also built on the existing body of knowledge and insights developed by previous generations of developer platform practitioners. 

Wherever possible, we have directly cited the original source inline. In addition, we found the following resources especially useful in sharpening our general thinking.

## Methods

### DORA Metrics

The DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics provide data-driven insights into software delivery performance. These metrics inspired many of the performance indicators we use throughout this guide, especially lead time, deployment frequency, change failure rate, and recovery time.
