# Authorship

The Gruntwork Way was originally authored by [Josh Padnick](https://joshpadnick.com) with input from fellow Grunts Yousif Akbar, Lewis Christie, Oreoluwa Agunbiade, Brian Torres, [Yevgeniy Brikman](https://ybrikman.com) through his book [The Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery](https://www.fundamentals-of-devops.com/), and especially Eben Eliason.

It is intended to be a living, evolving knowledge set, so it is our hope that if you find something you believe can be improved that you will [open a Pull Request](/2.0/way/intro/share-your-feedback) suggesting it!
