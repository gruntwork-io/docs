# Scorecard

**Assess standards compliance**

A scorecard evaluates repositories, deployments, or teams against your organization's standards and best practices. It provides objective measures of infrastructure quality and compliance.

## Why it matters

Standards only matter if you can measure compliance. Scorecards make standards concrete and visible, helping teams understand where they meet expectations and where they need improvement.

## What it enables

- Objective measurement of standards compliance
- Identification of high-risk infrastructure
- Benchmarking teams against each other
- Progress tracking on improvement initiatives
