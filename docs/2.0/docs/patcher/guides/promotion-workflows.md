# Using Patcher Promotion Workflows

This guide covers setting up promotion workflows to move updates across multiple environments (dev → stage → prod). You should use this guide only after you have Patcher set up for [ongoing updates](/2.0/docs/patcher/guides/ongoing-updates).

## What are promotion workflows?

Rolling out updates to infrastructure-as-code is already painful. But it becomes doubly so when you need to roll out changes across many environments (e.g. from dev to stage to prod). In that case, you must choose between two unsatisfying options:

1. Update many environments at once and hope that prod doesn't break
2. Incrementally roll out your updates (e.g. open a pull request updating dev, then stage, then prod), but manually re-create effectively the same pull request many times.

In short, you can choose between confidence and efficiency, but historically you can't get both.

With promotion workflows, we aim to bridge that gap in a small way. You can now open a pull request that updates OpenTofu/Terraform/Terragrunt code only your initial rollout environment (e.g. dev). Once you merge that pull request, Patcher promotion workflows automatically open a corresponding pull request that updates all the same dependencies for your next rollout environment (e.g. stage). The process continues until you reach prod.

This way, you can incrementally roll out your changes, but you lessen the pain of doing so because the pull requests for each subsequent environment are created automatically for you.

### Limitations

Promotion workflows define their subsequent updates based on the initial `patcher report` run. If you make manual updates to an individual pull request (e.g. by removing a dependency update), Patcher promotion workflows do not currently recognize that.

Of course, you can always just manually update the subsequent pull requests, so this isn't a blocker, but it's admittedly a limitation.

## Prerequisites

### Supported CI systems

Gruntwork officially supports Patcher Promotion Workflows using GitHub Actions.

### Organizing environments as folder structures 

To support multiple environments (such as `dev`, `stage`, and `prod`), your codebase must represent these environments with a consistent folder structure that can be grouped using glob pattern matching.

For example, if your environments were organized like this:

```sh
$ ll
dev-account1
dev-account2
prod-account1
prod-account2
stage-account1
stage-account2
```

You could define your Patcher environments as `dev-*`, `stage-*`, and `prod-*`. 

## Implementation & setup example 

The Patcher Promotion Workflow process consists of a series of GitHub Actions workflow files, where each environment is represented as an individual workflow. The process begins with the lowest environment (typically `dev`). It scans the entire `dev` environment for dependencies that require updates and generates one pull request per dependency. Each pull request updates the dependency specifically in the `dev` environment. 

After a pull request is approved and merged in the dev environment, Patcher automatically triggers pull requests for the next environment (e.g., `stage`) via repository dispatch events. This step-by-step promotion continues until production is updated.

To get started quickly, copy and customize the example files below to match your environment names. In this example, the promotion workflow moves updates sequentially across `dev`, `stage`, and finally `prod`. 

### Setting up the initial dev promotion step 

The initial GitHub Actions workflow file, `update-dev.yml` in this example, highlights the following key components: 

* **Job triggers**: 
    * The job is configured to run on a schedule, pull request targets, workflow dispatch, and repository dispatch events. 
        * A **schedule** is optional but recommended for regular updates. 
        * **Workflow dispatch** is a recommended testing mechanism. 
        * The **pull request target** is required to trigger certain dependent jobs. 

* **`trigger-next-env` job**: 
    * This job runs **only** when a pull request is merged. It sends a repository dispatch event (`dev_updates_merged`) to trigger the next environment’s workflow. 
    * It includes metadata, specifically a `dependency` (derived from the Git branch name), to inform the subsequent job which dependency to process. 

* **`patcher-report` job**: 
    * This job runs `patcher report` to generate a list of updates for a specific environment, using the `include_dirs` argument to target that environment. 
    * It uses a secret, `PIPELINES_READ_TOKEN`, which must have access to your Gruntwork account to download the Patcher binary. For details on setting up machine user tokens, see [here](/2.0/docs/pipelines/installation/viamachineusers). 

* **`update-env` job**: 
    * This job processes the `spec` output from the `patcher report` command, saves it to a file, and then runs `patcher update`. 
    * The `patcher update` command reads the `spec` file, checks out the repository code, commits the changes, and pushes a pull request. 
    * For the pull request workflow to function correctly, the `pull_request_branch` must follow the format `$PREFIX$DEPENDENCYID`. This format allows the workflow to track and process updates accurately. The `trigger-next-env` job strips out the prefix.

:::info
As of `v0.14.x` (`patcher-action` `v2.10.x`), Patcher has deprecated support of checking in the spec output file from a `patcher report` run into your codebase. 
This file, similar to an OpenTofu plan file, is intended to be a temporary artifact to capture run details between `report` and `update`.   
We recommend that you delete and `.gitignore` any spec files in your codebase.

### Setting up the stage step

The `update-stage.yml` workflow file is nearly identical to `update-dev.yml`.

The key differences are: 
* The `repository_dispatch` event type is now `dev_updates_merged`.
* The `include_dirs` argument targets the `stage` environment instead of `dev`.
* The `PR_BRANCH_PREFIX` and `pull_request_title` reference the `stage` environment instead of `dev`.

```

### Setting up the prod stage

The `update-prod.yml` workflow file is nearly identical to `update-stage.yml`.

The key differences are:
* The `repository_dispatch` event type is now `stage_updates_merged`.
* The `include_dirs` argument targets the `prod` environment instead of `stage`. 
* The `PR_BRANCH_PREFIX` and `pull_request_title` reference the `prod` environment instead of `stage`.
* Since this is the final environment in the chain, the `trigger-next-env` job is no longer needed.
