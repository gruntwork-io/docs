# Setting up Pipelines Drift Detection

If you are a Pipelines Enterprise customer using GitHub or GitLab and used the infrastructure-live-root repository template to install Pipelines, Drift Detection is already included and available as a workflow in your repository.

For standalone installations that did not use the `infrastructure-live-root` repository template, follow the [Installing Drift Detection Guide](/2.0/docs/pipelines/guides/installing-drift-detection.md) to enable Drift Detection.
