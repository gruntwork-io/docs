# Setting up Pipelines Drift Detection

If you're a Pipelines Enterprise customer and you installed Pipelines using our infrastructure-live-root repository template then Drift Detection is already installed and available as a GitHub workflow in your repository.

If you installed Pipelines in a manner other than from the template and you're an enterprise customer and you want to add Drift Detection, see the [Installing Drift Detection Guide](/2.0/docs/pipelines/guides/installing-drift-detection.md).
