# Adding Branch Protection to a GitHub Repository

Gruntwork Pipelines is designed to function within a pull request (PR) based workflow. Approving a pull request signals approval to deploy infrastructure, so it's important to configure repository settings and branch protection accurately.

## GitHub Recommended Settings

By default, Gruntwork Pipelines runs a `plan` on every push to a PR and an `apply` on every push to `main`. To ensure that infrastructure changes are reviewed and approved before deployment, branch protection should be enabled on `main` to prevent unauthorized changes.

- Enable **Require a pull request before merging** to ensure all changes go through a pull request.
- Enable **Require approvals** to require at least one approval before merging. Optionally, configure more than one required approval.
- Enable **Require review from code owners** for controlled reviews of specific code areas. For more details, see [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).
- Enable **Require status checks to pass before merging** to ensure the `apply` does not run if the `plan` fails, or if organizational validation rules fail.
- Enable **Require branches to be up to date before merging** and select the `Pipelines` workflow as required.

    This prevents running an inaccurate `apply` by ensuring the PR is up-to-date. However, it increases GitHub Actions minute usage. If disabled, another PR merged into `main` after the `plan` could lead to an inaccurate `apply`. Evaluate whether this tradeoff aligns with your organization's risk tolerance.

  Consider enabling **Do not allow bypassing the above settings** to prevent admins from bypassing branch protection rules. While this improves security, it may limit options for emergency fixes.

  GitHub Enterprise customers can also configure [push rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets#push-rulesets). This feature allows restricting edits to `.github/workflows` files, ensuring infrastructure changes are properly reviewed and approved through Pipelines. Follow the documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/creating-rulesets-for-a-repository#creating-a-push-ruleset) to enable push rulesets if available.

## Securing User Accounts

Branch protection rules are only effective if you are confident that the users who have access to your repository are legitimate and trusted.

You can improve your security posture by ensuring that:

1. [User accounts have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).
2. [User accounts don't have compromised credentials](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure).
3. [User accounts are granted access to infrastructure-live repositories on a least privilege basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Developers make infrastructure changes on a branch and create a pull request (PR) against the default branch.
2. On pull request creation, Gruntwork Pipelines runs `plan` for any changes and posts the results as a comment.
3. Gruntwork Pipelines re-runs `plan` on every push to the branch and updates the results in a comment.
4. Gather approvals. If Code Owners is enabled, all relevant code owners must approve the changes.
5. Once approved, merge the pull request into the default branch.
6. Gruntwork Pipelines runs `apply` for the changes from the pull request.
   - On success, the pull request is updated to indicate the successful `apply`.
   - On failure, the pull request is updated to indicate the failure of the `apply`. If the failure cannot be resolved by retrying, a new pull request must be created to address the issues.
