To configure Gruntwork Pipelines in a new GitLab project, complete the following steps (which are explained in detail below):

1. (If using a self-hosted GitLab instance) Ensure OIDC configuration and JWKS are publicly accessible.
2. Create an `infrastructure-live` project.
3. Configure machine user tokens for GitLab access, or ensure that the appropriate machine user tokens are set up as project or organization secrets.
4. Create `.gruntwork` HCL configurations to tell Pipelines how to authenticate in your environments.
5. Create `.gitlab-ci.yml` to tell your GitLab CI/CD pipeline how to run your pipelines.
6. Commit and push your changes to your project.

## Ensure OIDC configuration and JWKS are publicly accessible

This step only applies if you are using a self-hosted GitLab instance that is not accessible from the public internet. If you are using GitLab.com or a self-hosted instance that is publicly accessible, you can skip this step.

1. [Follow GitLab's instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/cloud_services/aws/#configure-a-non-public-gitlab-instance) for hosting your OIDC configuration and JWKS in a public location (e.g. S3 Bucket). This is necessary for both Gruntwork and the AWS OIDC provider to access the GitLab OIDC configuration and JWKS when authenticating JWT's generated by your custom instance.
2. Note the <CustomizableValue id="ISSUER_URL" /> (stored as `ci_id_tokens_issuer_url` in your `gitlab.rb` file per GitLab's instructions) generated above for reuse in the next steps.

## Creating the infrastructure-live project

Creating an `infrastructure-live` project is fairly straightforward. First, create a new project using the official GitLab documentation for [creating repositories](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/). Name the project something like `infrastructure-live` and make it private (or internal).

## Configuring SCM Access

Pipelines needs the ability to interact with Source Control Management (SCM) platforms to fetch resources (e.g. IaC code, reusable CI/CD code and the Pipelines binary itself).

For GitLab, you'll need to configure SCM access using [machine users](/2.0/docs/pipelines/installation/viamachineusers) with appropriate Personal Access Tokens (PATs).

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox id="configure-scm-access" label="Configure SCM access for Pipelines using machine users with GitLab PATs." />

:::

## Creating Cloud Resources for Pipelines

To start using Pipelines, you'll need to ensure that requisite cloud resources are provisioned in your cloud provider(s) to start managing your infrastructure with Pipelines.

:::note

If you are using the [Gruntwork Account Factory](/2.0/docs/accountfactory/architecture), this will be done automatically during onboarding and in the process of [vending every new AWS account](/2.0/docs/accountfactory/guides/vend-aws-account), so you don't need to worry about this.

:::

Clone your `infrastructure-live` project repository to your local machine using [Git](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/index.html#clone-a-repository).

:::tip

If you don't have Git installed, you can install it by following the official guide for [Git installation](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

:::

For example:

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:acme/infrastructure-live.git
cd infrastructure-live
```

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox id="clone-repository" label="Clone the `infrastructure-live` project repository locally." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="cd-into-repository" label="Navigate into the `infrastructure-live` repository." />

:::

To bootstrap your `infrastructure-live` repository, we'll use Boilerplate to scaffold it with the necessary IaC code to provision the infrastructure necessary for Pipelines to function.

The easiest way to install Boilerplate is to use `mise` to install it.

:::tip

If you don't have `mise` installed, you can install it by following the official guide for [mise installation](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html).

:::

```bash
mise use -g boilerplate@latest
```

:::tip

If you'd rather install a specific version of Boilerplate, you can use the `ls-remote` command to list the available versions.

```bash
mise ls-remote boilerplate
```

### Cloud-specific bootstrap instructions

The resources that you need provisioned in AWS to start managing resources with Pipelines are:

1. An OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider
2. An IAM role for Pipelines to assume when running Terragrunt plan commands
3. An IAM role for Pipelines to assume when running Terragrunt apply commands

For every account you want Pipelines to manage infrastructure in.

:::tip Don't Panic!

This may seem like a lot to set up, but the content you need to add to your `infrastructure-live` repository is minimal. The majority of the work will be pulled from a reusable catalog that you'll reference in your `infrastructure-live` repository.

If you want to peruse the catalog that's used in the bootstrap process, you can take a look at the [terragrunt-scale-catalog](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog) repository.

:::

The process that we'll follow to get these resources ready for Pipelines is:

1. Set up the Terragrunt configurations in your `infrastructure-live` repository for bootstrapping Pipelines in a single AWS account
2. Use Terragrunt to provision these resources in your AWS account
3. (Optionally) Bootstrap additional AWS accounts until all your AWS accounts are ready for Pipelines

{/* We're using an h3 tag here instead of a markdown heading to avoid adding content to the ToC that won't work when switching between tabs */}
<h3>Bootstrap your `infrastructure-live` repository</h3>

To bootstrap your `infrastructure-live` repository, we'll use Boilerplate to scaffold it with the necessary content for Pipelines to function.

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/gitlab/infrastructure-live?ref=v1.0.0' \
  --output-folder .
```

:::tip

You can just reply `y` to all the prompts to include dependencies, and accept defaults unless you want to customize something.

Alternatively, you could run Boilerplate non-interactively by passing the `--non-interactive` flag. You'll need to supply the relevant values for required variables in that case.

e.g.

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/gitlab/infrastructure-live?ref=v1.0.0' \
  --output-folder . \
  --var 'AccountName=dev' \
  --var 'GitLabGroupName=acme' \
  --var 'GitLabRepoName=infrastructure-live' \
  --var 'GitLabInstanceURL=https://gitlab.com' \
  --var 'AWSAccountID=123456789012' \
  --var 'AWSRegion=us-east-1' \
  --var 'StateBucketName=my-state-bucket' \
  --non-interactive
```

You can also choose to store these values in a YAML file and pass it to Boilerplate using the `--var-file` flag.

```yaml title="vars.yml"
AccountName: dev
GitLabGroupName: acme
GitLabRepoName: infrastructure-live
GitLabInstanceURL: https://gitlab.com
AWSAccountID: 123456789012
AWSRegion: us-east-1
StateBucketName: my-state-bucket
```

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/gitlab/infrastructure-live?ref=v1.0.0' \
  --output-folder . \
  --var-file vars.yml \
  --non-interactive
```

If you're using a self-hosted GitLab instance, you'll want to make sure the issuer is set correctly when calling Boilerplate.

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/gitlab/infrastructure-live?ref=v1.0.0' \
  --output-folder . \
  --var 'AccountName=dev' \
  --var 'GitLabGroupName=acme' \
  --var 'GitLabRepoName=infrastructure-live' \
  --var 'GitLabInstanceURL=https://gitlab.com' \
  --var 'AWSAccountID=123456789012' \
  --var 'AWSRegion=us-east-1' \
  --var 'StateBucketName=my-state-bucket' \
  --var 'Issuer=$$ISSUER_URL$$' \
  --non-interactive
```

Next, install Terragrunt and OpenTofu locally (the `.mise.toml` file in the root of the repository after scaffolding should already be set to the versions you want for Terragrunt and OpenTofu):

```bash
mise install
```

:::

{/* We're using an h3 tag here instead of a markdown heading to avoid adding content to the ToC that won't work when switching between tabs */}
<h3>Provisioning the resources</h3>

Once you've set up the Terragrunt configurations, you can use Terragrunt to provision the resources in your AWS account.

:::tip

Make sure that you're authenticated with AWS locally before proceeding.

You can follow the documentation [here](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/hashicorp/aws/latest#authentication-and-configuration) to authenticate with the AWS provider. You are advised to choose an authentication method that doesn't require any hard-coded credentials, like assuming an IAM role.

:::

First, make sure that everything is set up correctly by running a plan in the `bootstrap` directory in `name-of-account/_global` where `name-of-account` is the name of the first AWS account you want to bootstrap.

```bash title="name-of-account/_global/bootstrap"
terragrunt run --all --non-interactive --provider-cache plan
```

:::tip

We're using the `--provider-cache` flag here to ensure that we don't re-download the AWS provider on every run by leveraging the [Terragrunt Provider Cache Server](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/provider-cache-server/).

:::

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox id="run-aws-plan" label="Run a plan in the bootstrap directory to make sure that everything is set up correctly." />

:::

Next, apply the changes to your account.

```bash title="name-of-account/_global/bootstrap"
terragrunt run --all --non-interactive --provider-cache apply
```

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox id="run-aws-apply" label="Run an apply in the bootstrap directory to provision the resources in your AWS account." />

:::

{/* We're using an h3 tag here instead of a markdown heading to avoid adding content to the ToC that won't work when switching between tabs */}
<h3>Optional: Bootstrapping additional AWS accounts</h3>

If you have multiple AWS accounts, and you want to bootstrap them as well, you can do so by following a similar, but slightly condensed process.

For each additional account you want to bootstrap, you'll use Boilerplate in the root of your `infrastructure-live` repository to scaffold out the necessary content for just that account.

:::tip

If you are going to bootstrap more AWS accounts, you'll probably want to commit your existing changes before proceeding.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add core Pipelines scaffolding [skip ci]"
```

The `[skip ci]` in the commit message is just in-case you push your changes up to your repository at this state, as you don't want to trigger Pipelines yet.

:::

Just like before, you'll use Boilerplate to scaffold out the necessary content for just that account.

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/gitlab/infrastructure-live?ref=v1.0.0' \
  --output-folder .
```

:::tip

Again, you can just reply `y` to all the prompts to include dependencies, and accept defaults unless you want to customize something.

Alternatively, you could run Boilerplate non-interactively by passing the `--non-interactive` flag. You'll need to supply the relevant values for required variables in that case.

e.g.

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/gitlab/account?ref=v1.0.0' \
  --output-folder . \
  --var 'AccountName=prod' \
  --var 'AWSAccountID=987654321012' \
  --var 'AWSRegion=us-east-1' \
  --var 'StateBucketName=my-prod-state-bucket' \
  --var 'GitLabGroupName=acme' \
  --var 'GitLabRepoName=infrastructure-live' \
  --var 'GitLabInstanceURL=https://gitlab.com' \
  --non-interactive
```

If you prefer to store the values in a YAML file and pass it to Boilerplate using the `--var-file` flag, you can do so like this:

```yaml title="vars.yml"
AccountName: prod
AWSAccountID: 987654321012
AWSRegion: us-east-1
StateBucketName: my-prod-state-bucket
GitLabGroupName: acme
GitLabRepoName: infrastructure-live
GitLabInstanceURL: https://gitlab.com
```

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/gitlab/account?ref=v1.0.0' \
  --output-folder . \
  --var-file vars.yml \
  --non-interactive
```

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox id="scaffold-additional-account" label="Use Boilerplate to scaffold out additional AWS accounts." />

:::

Once you've scaffolded out the additional accounts you want to bootstrap, you can use Terragrunt to provision the resources in each of these accounts.

:::tip

Make sure that you authenticate to each AWS account you are bootstrapping using AWS credentials for that account before you attempt to provision resources in it.

:::

For each account you want to bootstrap, you'll need to run the following commands:

```bash
cd <account-name>/_global/bootstrap
terragrunt run --all --non-interactive --provider-cache plan
terragrunt run --all --non-interactive --provider-cache apply
```

:::note Progress Checklist
