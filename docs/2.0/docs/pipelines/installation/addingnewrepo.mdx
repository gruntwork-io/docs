# Bootstrap Pipelines in a New GitHub Repository

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs"
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem"
import PersistentCheckbox from "/src/components/PersistentCheckbox"

To configure Gruntwork Pipelines in a new GitHub repository, complete the following steps (which are explained in detail below):

1. Create an `infrastructure-live` repository.
2. Configure the Gruntwork.io GitHub App to authorize your `infrastructure-live` repository, or ensure that the appropriate machine user tokens are set up as repository or organization secrets.
3. Create `.gruntwork` HCL configurations to tell Pipelines how to authenticate in your environments.
4. Create `.github/workflows/pipelines.yml` to tell your GitHub Actions workflow how to run your pipelines.
5. Commit and push your changes to your repository.

## Creating the infrastructure-live repository

Creating an `infrastructure-live` repository is fairly straightforward. First, create a new repository using the official GitHub documentation for [creating repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository). Name the repository something like `infrastructure-live` and make it private (or internal).

## Configuring SCM Access

Pipelines needs the ability to interact with Source Control Management (SCM) platforms to fetch resources (e.g. IaC code, reusable CI/CD code and the Pipelines binary itself).

There are two ways to configure SCM access for Pipelines:

1. Using the [Gruntwork.io GitHub App](/2.0/docs/pipelines/installation/viagithubapp#configuration) (recommended for most GitHub users).
2. Using a [machine user](/2.0/docs/pipelines/installation/viamachineusers) (recommended for GitHub users who cannot use the GitHub App).

## Creating Cloud Resources for Pipelines

To start using Pipelines, you'll need to ensure that requisite cloud resources are provisioned in your cloud provider(s) to start managing your infrastructure with Pipelines.

:::note

If you are using the [Gruntwork Account Factory](/2.0/docs/accountfactory/architecture), this will be done automatically during onboarding and in the process of [vending every new AWS account](/2.0/docs/accountfactory/guides/vend-aws-account), so you don't need to worry about this.

:::

Clone your `infrastructure-live` repository to your local machine using [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

:::tip

If you don't have Git installed, you can install it by following the official guide for [Git installation](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

:::

For example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:acme/infrastructure-live.git
cd infrastructure-live
```

:::note Progress Checklist

  id="clone-repository"
  label="Clone the `infrastructure-live` repository locally."
/>
<PersistentCheckbox
  id="cd-into-repository"
  label="Navigate into the `infrastructure-live` repository."
/>

:::

To bootstrap your `infrastructure-live` repository, we'll use Boilerplate to scaffold it with the necessary IaC code to provision the infrastructure necessary for Pipelines to function.

The easiest way to install Boilerplate is to use `mise` to install it.

:::tip

If you don't have `mise` installed, you can install it by following the official guide for [mise installation](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html).

:::

```bash
mise use -g boilerplate@latest
```

:::tip

If you'd rather install a specific version of Boilerplate, you can use the `ls-remote` command to list the available versions.

```bash
mise ls-remote boilerplate
```

### Cloud-specific bootstrap instructions

<Tabs groupId="cloud" queryString="cloud">
<TabItem value="aws" label="AWS" default>

The resources that you need provisioned in AWS to start managing resources with Pipelines are:

1. An OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider
2. An IAM role for Pipelines to assume when running Terragrunt plan commands
3. An IAM role for Pipelines to assume when running Terragrunt apply commands

For every account you want Pipelines to manage infrastructure in.

:::tip Don't Panic!

This may seem like a lot to set up, but the content you need to add to your `infrastructure-live` repository is minimal. The majority of the work will be pulled from a reusable catalog that you'll reference in your `infrastructure-live` repository.

If you want to peruse the catalog that's used in the bootstrap process, you can take a look at the [terragrunt-scale-catalog](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog) repository.

:::

The process that we'll follow to get these resources ready for Pipelines is:

1. Set up the Terragrunt configurations in your `infrastructure-live` repository for bootstrapping Pipelines in a single AWS account
2. Use Terragrunt to provision these resources in your AWS account
3. (Optionally) Bootstrap additional AWS accounts until all your AWS accounts are ready for Pipelines

{/* We're using an h3 tag here instead of a markdown heading to avoid adding content to the ToC that won't work when switching between tabs */}

<h3>Bootstrap your `infrastructure-live` repository</h3>

To bootstrap your `infrastructure-live` repository, we'll use Boilerplate to scaffold it with the necessary content for Pipelines to function.

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/github/infrastructure-live?ref=v1.1.0' \
  --output-folder .
```

:::tip

You can just reply `y` to all the prompts to include dependencies, and accept defaults unless you want to customize something.

Alternatively, you could run Boilerplate non-interactively by passing the `--non-interactive` flag. You'll need to supply the relevant values for required variables in that case.

e.g.

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/github/infrastructure-live?ref=v1.1.0' \
  --output-folder . \
  --var 'AccountName=dev' \
  --var 'GitHubOrgName=acme' \
  --var 'GitHubRepoName=infrastructure-live' \
  --var 'AWSAccountID=123456789012' \
  --var 'AWSRegion=us-east-1' \
  --var 'StateBucketName=my-state-bucket' \
  --non-interactive
```

You can also choose to store these values in a YAML file and pass it to Boilerplate using the `--var-file` flag.

```yaml title="vars.yml"
AccountName: dev
GitHubOrgName: acme
GitHubRepoName: infrastructure-live
AWSAccountID: 123456789012
AWSRegion: us-east-1
StateBucketName: my-state-bucket
```

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/github/infrastructure-live?ref=v1.1.0' \
  --output-folder . \
  --var-file vars.yml \
  --non-interactive
```

Next, install Terragrunt and OpenTofu locally (the `.mise.toml` file in the root of the repository after scaffolding should already be set to the versions you want for Terragrunt and OpenTofu):

```bash

```

{/* We're using an h3 tag here instead of a markdown heading to avoid adding content to the ToC that won't work when switching between tabs */}

<h3>Provisioning the resources</h3>

Once you've set up the Terragrunt configurations, you can use Terragrunt to provision the resources in your AWS account.

:::tip

Make sure that you're authenticated with AWS locally before proceeding.

You can follow the documentation [here](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/hashicorp/aws/latest#authentication-and-configuration) to authenticate with the AWS provider. You are advised to choose an authentication method that doesn't require any hard-coded credentials, like assuming an IAM role.

:::

First, make sure that everything is set up correctly by running a plan in the `bootstrap` directory in `name-of-account/_global` where `name-of-account` is the name of the first AWS account you want to bootstrap.

```bash title="name-of-account/_global/bootstrap"
terragrunt run --all --non-interactive --provider-cache --backend-bootstrap plan
```

:::tip

We're using the `--provider-cache` flag here to ensure that we don't re-download the AWS provider on every run by leveraging the [Terragrunt Provider Cache Server](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/provider-cache-server/).

We're using the `--backend-bootstrap` flag here to tell Terragrunt to bootstrap the OpenTofu backend automatically for the account.

```

:::

{/* We're using an h3 tag here instead of a markdown heading to avoid adding content to the ToC that won't work when switching between tabs */}

<h3>Optional: Bootstrapping additional AWS accounts</h3>

If you have multiple AWS accounts, and you want to bootstrap them as well, you can do so by following a similar, but slightly condensed process.

For each additional account you want to bootstrap, you'll use Boilerplate in the root of your `infrastructure-live` repository to scaffold out the necessary content for just that account.

:::tip

If you are going to bootstrap more AWS accounts, you'll probably want to commit your existing changes before proceeding.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add core Pipelines scaffolding [skip ci]"
```

The `[skip ci]` in the commit message is just in-case you push your changes up to your repository at this state, as you don't want to trigger Pipelines yet.

:::

Just like before, you'll use Boilerplate to scaffold out the necessary content for just that account.

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/github/infrastructure-live?ref=v1.1.0' \
  --output-folder .
```

:::tip

Alternatively, you could run Boilerplate non-interactively by passing the `--non-interactive` flag. You'll need to supply the relevant values for required variables in that case.

e.g.

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/github/account?ref=v1.1.0' \
  --output-folder . \
  --var 'AccountName=prod' \
  --var 'AWSAccountID=987654321012' \
  --var 'AWSRegion=us-east-1' \
  --var 'StateBucketName=my-prod-state-bucket' \
  --var 'GitHubOrgName=acme' \
  --var 'GitHubRepoName=infrastructure-live' \
  --non-interactive
```

If you prefer to store the values in a YAML file and pass it to Boilerplate using the `--var-file` flag, you can do so like this:

```yaml title="vars.yml"
AccountName: prod
AWSAccountID: 987654321012
AWSRegion: us-east-1
StateBucketName: my-prod-state-bucket
GitHubOrgName: acme

Once you've scaffolded out the additional accounts you want to bootstrap, you can use Terragrunt to provision the resources in each of these accounts.

:::tip

Make sure that you authenticate to each AWS account you are bootstrapping using AWS credentials for that account before you attempt to provision resources in it.

:::

For each account you want to bootstrap, you'll need to run the following commands:

```bash
cd <account-name>/_global/bootstrap
terragrunt run --all --non-interactive --provider-cache --backend-bootstrap plan
terragrunt run --all --non-interactive --provider-cache apply

<h3>Provisioning the resources</h3>

Once you've set up the Terragrunt configurations, you can use Terragrunt to provision the resources in your Azure subscription.

If you haven't already, you'll want to authenticate to Azure using the `az` CLI.

```bash
az login
```

:::note Progress Checklist

:::

To dynamically configure the Azure provider with a given tenant ID and subscription ID, ensure that you are exporting the following environment variables if you haven't the values via the `az` CLI:

- `ARM_TENANT_ID`
- `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

For example:

```bash
export ARM_TENANT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"

<h3>Finalizing Terragrunt configurations</h3>

Once you've provisioned the resources in your Azure subscription, you can finalize the Terragrunt configurations using the bootstrap resources we just provisioned.

First, edit the `root.hcl` file in the root of your `infrastructure-live` repository to leverage the storage account we just provisioned.

```hcl title="root.hcl"
locals {
  sub_hcl = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("sub.hcl"))

  state_resource_group_name    = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_resource_group_name
  state_storage_account_name   = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_storage_account_name
  state_storage_container_name = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_storage_container_name
}

# FIXME: Uncomment the code below when you've successfully bootstrapped Pipelines state.
#
# remote_state {
#   backend = "azurerm"
#   generate = {
#     path      = "backend.tf"

#   config = {
#     resource_group_name  = local.state_resource_group_name
#     storage_account_name = local.state_storage_account_name
#     container_name       = local.state_storage_container_name
#     key                  = "${path_relative_to_include()}/tofu.tfstate"
#   }
# }

generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}

  resource_provider_registrations = "none"
}

provider "azuread" {}
EOF
}
```

Uncomment the section that defines the remote state backend, so that you can pull the resources provisioned so far into state.

```hcl title="root.hcl"
locals {
  sub_hcl = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("sub.hcl"))

  state_resource_group_name    = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_resource_group_name
  state_storage_account_name   = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_storage_account_name
  state_storage_container_name = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_storage_container_name
}

remote_state {
  backend = "azurerm"
  generate = {

}
```

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox
  id="uncomment-remote-state-backend"
  label="Uncomment the section that defines the remote state backend in the `root.hcl` file."

:::

Next, finalize the `.gruntwork/environment-<name-of-subscription>.hcl` file in the root of your `infrastructure-live` repository to reference the IDs for the applications we just provisioned.

```hcl title=".gruntwork/environment-<name-of-subscription>.hcl"
environment "dev" {
  filter {
    paths = ["dev/*"]
  }

  authentication {
    azure_oidc {
      tenant_id       = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
      subscription_id = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"

      plan_client_id  = "" # FIXME: Fill in the client ID for the plan application after bootstrapping
      apply_client_id = "" # FIXME: Fill in the client ID for the apply application after bootstrapping
    }
  }
}
```

You can find the values for the `plan_client_id` and `apply_client_id` by running `terragrunt stack output` in the `bootstrap` directory in `name-of-subscription/bootstrap`.

```bash
terragrunt stack output
```

The relevant bits that you want to extract from the stack output are the following:

```hcl
bootstrap = {
  apply_app = {
    client_id = "33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333"
  }
  plan_app = {
    client_id = "44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444"
  }
}
```

You can use those values to set the values for `plan_client_id` and `apply_client_id` in the `.gruntwork/environment-<name-of-subscription>.hcl` file.

If you prefer to store the values in a YAML file and pass it to Boilerplate using the `--var-file` flag, you can do so like this:

```yaml title="vars.yml"
AccountName: prod
GitHubOrgName: acme
GitHubRepoName: infrastructure-live
SubscriptionName: prod
AzureTenantID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

AzureLocation: East US
StateResourceGroupName: pipelines-rg
StateStorageAccountName: myprodsa
StateStorageContainerName: tfstate
```

```bash

  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/azure/github/subscription?ref=v1.1.0' \
  --output-folder . \

To avoid issues with the remote state backend not existing yet, you'll want to comment out your remote state backend configurations in your `root.hcl` file before you start the bootstrap process for these new subscriptions.

```hcl title="root.hcl"
locals {
  sub_hcl = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("sub.hcl"))

  state_resource_group_name    = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_resource_group_name
  state_storage_account_name   = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_storage_account_name
  state_storage_container_name = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_storage_container_name
}

# FIXME: Temporarily commented out again, pending successful bootstrap of the new subscription(s).
#
# remote_state {
#   backend = "azurerm"
#   generate = {
#     path      = "backend.tf"
#     if_exists = "overwrite"
#   }
#   config = {
#     resource_group_name  = local.state_resource_group_name
#     storage_account_name = local.state_storage_account_name
#     container_name       = local.state_storage_container_name
#     key                  = "${path_relative_to_include()}/tofu.tfstate"
#   }
# }

generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}

  resource_provider_registrations = "none"
}

provider "azuread" {}
EOF
}
```

Just like before, you can use Terragrunt to provision the resources in each of these subscriptions.

For each subscription you want to bootstrap, you'll need to run the following commands:

```bash
cd <subscription-name>/_global/bootstrap
terragrunt run --all --non-interactive --provider-cache plan
terragrunt run --all --non-interactive --provider-cache --no-stack-generate apply
```

:::tip

We're adding the `--no-stack-generate` flag here, as Terragrunt will already have the requisite stack configurations generated, and we don't want to accidentally overwrite any configurations while we have state stored locally before we pull them into remote state.

Next, you can pull the resources into state using the storage account we just provisioned.

First, edit the `root.hcl` file in the root of your `infrastructure-live` repository to uncomment the remote state backend configurations you commented out earlier.

```hcl title="root.hcl"
locals {
  sub_hcl = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("sub.hcl"))

  state_resource_group_name    = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_resource_group_name
  state_storage_account_name   = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_storage_account_name
  state_storage_container_name = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_storage_container_name
}

remote_state {
  backend = "azurerm"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite"
  }
  config = {
    resource_group_name  = local.state_resource_group_name
    storage_account_name = local.state_storage_account_name
    container_name       = local.state_storage_container_name
    key                  = "${path_relative_to_include()}/tofu.tfstate"
  }
}

generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}

  resource_provider_registrations = "none"
}

provider "azuread" {}
EOF
}
```

Next, you can pull the resources into state using the storage account we just provisioned.

```bash title="name-of-subscription"
terragrunt run --all --non-interactive --provider-cache --no-stack-generate -- init -migrate-state -force-copy
```

:::tip

We're adding the `-force-copy` flag here to avoid any issues with OpenTofu waiting for an interactive prompt to copy up local state.

<PersistentCheckbox
  id="run-init-migrate-state-force-copy"
  label="Pull the resources into state using Terragrunt."

:::

Finally, we can edit each of the `.gruntwork/environment-<name-of-subscription>.hcl` files in the root of your `infrastructure-live` repository to reference the IDs for the applications we just provisioned.

```hcl title=".gruntwork/environment-<name-of-subscription>.hcl"
environment "prod" {
  filter {
    paths = ["prod/*"]
  }

  authentication {
    azure_oidc {
      tenant_id       = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
      subscription_id = "99999999-9999-9999-9999-999999999999"

      plan_client_id  = "" # FIXME: Fill in the client ID for the plan application after bootstrapping
      apply_client_id = "" # FIXME: Fill in the client ID for the apply application after bootstrapping
    }
  }
}
```

You can find the values for the `plan_client_id` and `apply_client_id` by running `terragrunt stack output` in the `bootstrap` directory in `name-of-subscription/bootstrap`.

```bash
terragrunt stack output
```

The relevant bits that you want to extract from the stack output are the following:

```hcl
bootstrap = {
  apply_app = {
    client_id = "55555555-5555-5555-5555-555555555555"
  }
  plan_app = {
    client_id = "66666666-6666-6666-6666-666666666666"
  }
}
```

You can use those values to set the values for `plan_client_id` and `apply_client_id` in the `.gruntwork/environment-<name-of-subscription>.hcl` file.
