# Bootstrap Pipelines in an Existing GitLab Project

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import PersistentCheckbox from '/src/components/PersistentCheckbox';
import CustomizableValue from '/src/components/CustomizableValue';

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for integrating [Gruntwork Pipelines](https://gruntwork.io/products/pipelines/) into an existing GitLab project with Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This is designed for Gruntwork customers who want to add Pipelines to their current infrastructure projects for streamlined CI/CD management.

To configure Gruntwork Pipelines in an existing GitLab project, complete the following steps (which are explained in detail below):

1. **(If using a self-hosted GitLab instance) Ensure OIDC configuration and JWKS are publicly accessible.**
2. **Plan your Pipelines setup** by identifying all environments and cloud accounts/subscriptions you need to manage.
3. **Bootstrap core infrastructure** in accounts/subscriptions that don't already have the required OIDC and state management resources.
4. **Configure SCM access** using [machine users](/2.0/docs/pipelines/installation/viamachineusers) with appropriate Personal Access Tokens (PATs).
5. **Create `.gruntwork` HCL configurations** to tell Pipelines how to authenticate and organize your environments.
6. **Create `.gitlab-ci.yml`** to configure your GitLab CI/CD pipeline.
7. **Commit and push** your changes to activate Pipelines.

## Ensure OIDC configuration and JWKS are publicly accessible

This step only applies if you are using a self-hosted GitLab instance that is not accessible from the public internet. If you are using GitLab.com or a self-hosted instance that is publicly accessible, you can skip this step.

1. [Follow GitLab's instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/cloud_services/aws/#configure-a-non-public-gitlab-instance) for hosting your OIDC configuration and JWKS in a public location (e.g. S3 Bucket). This is necessary for both Gruntwork and the AWS OIDC provider to access the GitLab OIDC configuration and JWKS when authenticating JWT's generated by your custom instance.
2. Note the <CustomizableValue id="ISSUER_URL" /> (stored as `ci_id_tokens_issuer_url` in your `gitlab.rb` file per GitLab's instructions) generated above for reuse in the next steps.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **An active Gruntwork subscription** with Pipelines access. Verify by checking the [Gruntwork Developer Portal](https://app.gruntwork.io/account) and confirming access to "pipelines" repositories in your GitHub team.
- **Cloud provider credentials** with permissions to create OIDC providers and IAM roles in accounts where Pipelines will manage infrastructure.
- **Git installed** locally for cloning and managing your project.
- **Existing IaC project** with Terragrunt configurations you want to manage with Pipelines (if you are using OpenTofu/Terraform, and want to start using Terragrunt, read the [Quickstart Guide](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start)).

## Planning Your Pipelines Setup

Before implementing Pipelines, it's crucial to plan your setup by identifying all the environments and cloud resources you need to manage.

### Identify Your Environments

Review your existing project structure and identify:

1. **All environments** you want to manage with Pipelines (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`)
2. **Cloud accounts/subscriptions** associated with each environment
3. **Directory paths** in your project that contain Terragrunt units for each environment
4. **Existing OIDC resources** that may already be provisioned in your accounts

<PersistentCheckbox id="check-existing-oidc" label="Check if OIDC providers and IAM roles already exist in your cloud accounts." />

:::

### Determine Required OIDC Roles

For each AWS Account / Azure Subscription you want to manage, you might already have some or all of the following resources provisioned.

<Tabs groupId="cloud-provider">
<TabItem value="aws" label="AWS" default>

**Required AWS Resources:**

- An OIDC provider for GitLab
- An IAM role for Pipelines to assume when running Terragrunt plan commands
- An IAM role for Pipelines to assume when running Terragrunt apply commands

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="azure" label="Azure">

**Required Azure Resources:**

- Entra ID Application for plans with Federated Identity Credential
- Entra ID Application for applies with Federated Identity Credential
- Service Principals with appropriate role assignments
- Storage Account and Container for Terragrunt state storage (if not already existing)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<PersistentCheckbox id="identify-existing-resources" label="Identify which resources already exist and which need to be created." />

:::

## Configuring SCM Access

Pipelines needs the ability to interact with GitLab to fetch resources (e.g. IaC code, reusable CI/CD code and the Pipelines binary itself).

To create machine users for GitLab access, follow our [machine users guide](/2.0/docs/pipelines/installation/viamachineusers) to set up the appropriate Personal Access Tokens (PATs) with the required permissions.

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox id="configure-scm-access" label="Configure SCM access for Pipelines using machine users with GitLab PATs." />

:::

## Bootstrapping Cloud Infrastructure

If your AWS accounts / Azure subscriptions don't already have all the required OIDC and state management resources, you'll need to bootstrap them. This section provides the infrastructure code needed to set up these resources.

:::tip

If you already have all the resources listed, you can skip this section.

If you have some of them provisioned, but not all, you can decide to either destroy the resources you already have provisioned and recreate them or import them into state. If you are not sure, please contact [Gruntwork support](/support).

:::

### Prepare Your Project

Clone your project to your local machine using [Git](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/index.html#clone-a-repository) if you haven't already.

:::tip

If you don't have Git installed, you can install it by following the official guide for [Git installation](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

:::

For example:

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:acme/infrastructure-live.git
cd infrastructure-live
```

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox id="clone-repository" label="Clone your project locally (if not already done)." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="cd-into-repository" label="Navigate into your project." />

:::

To bootstrap your project, we'll use Boilerplate to scaffold it with the necessary IaC code to provision the infrastructure necessary for Pipelines to function.

The easiest way to install Boilerplate is to use `mise` to install it.

:::tip

If you don't have `mise` installed, you can install it by following the official guide for [mise installation](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html).

:::

```bash
mise use -g boilerplate@latest
```

:::tip

If you'd rather install a specific version of Boilerplate, you can use the `ls-remote` command to list the available versions.

```bash
mise ls-remote boilerplate
```

:::

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox id="install-boilerplate" label="Install Boilerplate." />

:::

If you don't already have Terragrunt and OpenTofu installed locally, you can install them using `mise`:

```bash
mise use -g terragrunt@latest opentofu@latest
```

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox id="install-terragrunt-and-opentofu" label="Install Terragrunt and OpenTofu locally (if not already installed)." />

### Cloud-specific bootstrap instructions

<Tabs groupId="cloud-provider">
<TabItem value="aws" label="AWS" default>

The resources you need provisioned in AWS to start managing resources with Pipelines are:

1. An OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider
2. An IAM role for Pipelines to assume when running Terragrunt plan commands
3. An IAM role for Pipelines to assume when running Terragrunt apply commands

For every account you want Pipelines to manage infrastructure in.

:::tip Don't Panic!

This may seem like a lot to set up, but the content you need to add to your project is minimal. The majority of the work will be pulled from a reusable catalog that you'll reference in your project.

If you want to peruse the catalog that's used in the bootstrap process, you can take a look at the [terragrunt-scale-catalog](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog) repository.

:::

The process that we'll follow to get these resources ready for Pipelines is:

1. Use Boilerplate to scaffold bootstrap configurations in your project for each AWS account
2. Use Terragrunt to provision these resources in your AWS accounts
3. (Optionally) Bootstrap additional AWS accounts until all your AWS accounts are ready for Pipelines

{/* We're using an h3 tag here instead of a markdown heading to avoid adding content to the ToC that won't work when switching between tabs */}
<h3>Bootstrap Your Project for AWS</h3>

First, confirm that you have a `root.hcl` file in the root of your project that looks something like this:

```hcl title="root.hcl"
locals {
  account_hcl       = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("account.hcl"))
  state_bucket_name = local.account_hcl.locals.state_bucket_name

  region_hcl = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("region.hcl"))
  aws_region = local.region_hcl.locals.aws_region
}

remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite"
  }
  config = {
    bucket       = local.state_bucket_name
    region       = local.aws_region
    key          = "${path_relative_to_include()}/tofu.tfstate"
    encrypt      = true
    use_lockfile = true
  }
}

generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "aws" {
  region = "${local.aws_region}"
}
EOF
}
```

If you don't have a `root.hcl` file, you might need to customize the bootstrapping process, as the Terragrunt scale catalog expects a `root.hcl` file in the root of the project. Please contact [Gruntwork support](/support) for assistance if you need help.

For each AWS account that needs bootstrapping, we'll use Boilerplate to scaffold the necessary content. Run this command from the root of your project for each account:

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/gitlab/account?ref=v1.1.0' \
  --output-folder .
```

:::tip

You'll need to run this boilerplate command once for each AWS account you want to manage with Pipelines. Boilerplate will prompt you for account-specific values each time.

:::

:::tip

You can reply `y` to all the prompts to include dependencies, and accept defaults unless you want to customize something.

Alternatively, you could run Boilerplate non-interactively by passing the `--non-interactive` flag. You'll need to supply the relevant values for required variables in that case.

e.g.

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/gitlab/account?ref=v1.1.0' \
  --output-folder . \
  --var 'AccountName=dev' \
  --var 'GitLabGroupName=acme' \
  --var 'GitLabRepoName=infrastructure-live' \
  --var 'GitLabInstanceURL=https://gitlab.com' \
  --var 'AWSAccountID=123456789012' \
  --var 'AWSRegion=us-east-1' \
  --var 'StateBucketName=my-state-bucket' \
  --non-interactive
```

If you're using a self-hosted GitLab instance, you'll want to make sure the issuer is set correctly when calling Boilerplate.

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/gitlab/account?ref=v1.1.0' \
  --output-folder . \
  --var 'AccountName=dev' \
  --var 'GitLabGroupName=acme' \
  --var 'GitLabRepoName=infrastructure-live' \
  --var 'GitLabInstanceURL=https://gitlab.com' \
  --var 'AWSAccountID=123456789012' \
  --var 'AWSRegion=us-east-1' \
  --var 'StateBucketName=my-state-bucket' \
  --var 'Issuer=$$ISSUER_URL$$' \
  --non-interactive
```

You can also choose to store these values in a YAML file and pass it to Boilerplate using the `--var-file` flag.

```yaml title="vars.yml"
AccountName: dev
GitLabGroupName: acme
GitLabRepoName: infrastructure-live
GitLabInstanceURL: https://gitlab.com
AWSAccountID: 123456789012
AWSRegion: us-east-1
StateBucketName: my-state-bucket
```

```bash
boilerplate \
  --template-url 'github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//templates/boilerplate/aws/gitlab/account?ref=v1.1.0' \
  --output-folder . \
  --var-file vars.yml \
  --non-interactive
```

<h3>Provision AWS Bootstrap Resources</h3>

Once you've scaffolded out the accounts you want to bootstrap, you can use Terragrunt to provision the resources in each of these accounts.

:::tip

Make sure that you authenticate to each AWS account you are bootstrapping using AWS credentials for that account before you attempt to provision resources in it.

You can follow the documentation [here](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/hashicorp/aws/latest#authentication-and-configuration) to authenticate with the AWS provider. You are advised to choose an authentication method that doesn't require any hard-coded credentials, like assuming an IAM role.

:::

For each account you want to bootstrap, you'll need to run the following commands:

First, make sure that everything is set up correctly by running a plan in the `bootstrap` directory in `name-of-account/_global` where `name-of-account` is the name of the AWS account you want to bootstrap.

```bash title="name-of-account/_global/bootstrap"
terragrunt run --all --non-interactive --provider-cache --backend-bootstrap plan
```

:::tip

We're using the `--provider-cache` flag here to ensure that we don't re-download the AWS provider on every run by leveraging the [Terragrunt Provider Cache Server](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/provider-cache-server/).

We're using the `--backend-bootstrap` flag here to tell Terragrunt to bootstrap the OpenTofu backend automatically for the account.

:::

Next, apply the changes to your account.

```bash title="name-of-account/_global/bootstrap"
terragrunt run --all --non-interactive --provider-cache apply
```

To dynamically configure the Azure provider with a given tenant ID and subscription ID, ensure that you are exporting the following environment variables if you haven't the values via the `az` CLI:

- `ARM_TENANT_ID`
- `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

For example:

```bash
export ARM_TENANT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

<h3>Finalizing Terragrunt configurations</h3>

Once you've provisioned the resources in your Azure subscription, you can finalize the Terragrunt configurations using the bootstrap resources we just provisioned.

First, edit the `root.hcl` file in the root of your project to leverage the storage account we just provisioned.

If your `root.hcl` file doesn't already have a remote state backend configuration, you'll need to add one that looks like this:

```hcl title="root.hcl"
locals {
  sub_hcl = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("sub.hcl"))

  state_resource_group_name    = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_resource_group_name
  state_storage_account_name   = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_storage_account_name
  state_storage_container_name = local.sub_hcl.locals.state_storage_container_name
}

    key                  = "${path_relative_to_include()}/tofu.tfstate"
  }
}

}

provider "azuread" {}
EOF
}
```

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox id="add-remote-state-backend" label="Add or uncomment the section that defines the remote state backend in the `root.hcl` file." />

:::

Next, finalize the `.gruntwork/environment-<name-of-subscription>.hcl` file in the root of your project to reference the IDs for the applications we just provisioned.

You can find the values for the `plan_client_id` and `apply_client_id` by running `terragrunt stack output` in the `bootstrap` directory in `name-of-subscription/bootstrap`.

```bash
terragrunt stack output
```

The relevant bits that you want to extract from the stack output are the following:

```hcl
bootstrap = {
  apply_app = {
    client_id = "33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333"

  plan_app = {
    client_id = "44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444"
  }
}
```

You can use those values to set the values for `plan_client_id` and `apply_client_id` in the `.gruntwork/environment-<name-of-subscription>.hcl` file.

<h3>Pulling the resources into state</h3>

Once you've provisioned the resources in your Azure subscription, you can pull the resources into state using the storage account we just provisioned.

```bash title="name-of-subscription"
terragrunt run --all --non-interactive --provider-cache --no-stack-generate -- init -migrate-state -force-copy
```

## Creating `.gruntwork` HCL Configurations

Create [HCL configurations](/2.0/reference/pipelines/configurations-as-code/) in the `.gruntwork` directory in the root of your project to tell Pipelines how you plan to organize your infrastructure, and how you plan to have Pipelines authenticate with your cloud provider(s).

### The `repository` block

The core configuration that you'll want to start with is the `repository` block. This block tells Pipelines which branch has the "live" infrastructure you want provisioned. When you merge IaC to this branch, Pipelines will be triggered to update your infrastructure accordingly.

```hcl title=".gruntwork/repository.hcl"
repository {
  deploy_branch_name = "main"
}
```

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox id="edit-repository-deploy-branch-name" label="Edit the value of `deploy_branch_name` in `.gruntwork/repository.hcl` if necessary." />

:::

### The `environment` block

Next, you'll want to define the environments you want to manage with Pipelines using the [`environment` block](/2.0/reference/pipelines/configurations-as-code/api#environment-block).

For each environment, you'll want to define a [`filter` block](/2.0/reference/pipelines/configurations-as-code/api#filter-block) that tells Pipelines which units are part of that environment. You'll also want to define an [`authentication` block](/2.0/reference/pipelines/configurations-as-code/api#authentication-block) that tells Pipelines how to authenticate with your cloud provider(s) for that environment.

## Creating `.gitlab-ci.yml`

Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
include:
  - project: 'gruntwork-io/gitlab-pipelines-workflows'
    file: '/workflows/pipelines.yml'
    ref: 'v1'
```

:::tip

You can read the [Pipelines GitLab CI Workflow](https://gitlab.com/gruntwork-io/gitlab-pipelines-workflows) to learn how this GitLab CI pipeline calls the Pipelines CLI to run your pipelines.

🚀 You've successfully added Gruntwork Pipelines to your existing GitLab project!

## Next Steps

You have successfully completed the installation of Gruntwork Pipelines in an existing GitLab project. Proceed to [Deploying your first infrastructure change](/2.0/docs/pipelines/tutorials/deploying-your-first-infrastructure-change) to begin deploying changes.

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter issues during the setup process, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

### Bootstrap Resources Failure

If your bootstrap resource provisioning fails:

<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-credentials" label="Confirm that you have the correct cloud provider credentials and permissions to create resources in your AWS Accounts / Azure Subscriptions." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-aws-unique-names" label="For AWS: Confirm that your S3 bucket names are globally unique and follow relevant naming restrictions from AWS." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-azure-unique-names" label="For Azure: Confirm that your storage account names are globally unique and follow relevant naming restrictions from Azure." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-gitlab-group-project" label="Ensure your GitLab group and project names in the bootstrap configurations match your actual GitLab group and project." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-environment-variables" label="For Azure: Confirm that you have exported the ARM_TENANT_ID and ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID environment variables." />

### HCL Configuration Issues

If your HCL configurations aren't working as expected:

<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-paths" label="Verify that the paths in your filter blocks correctly match your project structure." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-account-ids" label="For AWS: Confirm that all Account IDs and role names are correct." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-azure-values" label="For Azure: Confirm that all Tenant IDs, Subscription IDs and Client IDs are correct." />

### GitLab CI Pipeline Issues

If your GitLab CI pipeline isn't working as expected:

<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-branch-names" label="Verify that the branch name in your pipeline configuration matches your deploy branch name." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-scm-access" label="Confirm that SCM access is properly configured with machine user PATs." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-permissions" label="Ensure that the machine user has the necessary permissions to access the project and run pipelines." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-aws-pipelines-config-trust" label="For AWS: Confirm that the roles you've provisioned have the appropriate trust relationship for their use-case (plans should trust all branches, applies should trust the deploy branch)." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-aws-string-like" label="For AWS: Confirm that the trust policy for the plan role you've provisioned uses StringLike for the sub condition and that it trusts all branches." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-azure-pipelines-config-trust" label="For Azure: Confirm that the Entra ID applications you've provisioned have the appropriate trust relationship for their use-case (plans should trust all branches, applies should trust the deploy branch)." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="troubleshoot-check-azure-flexible-federated-credential" label="For Azure: Confirm that the plan Entra ID application you've provisioned has a Flexible Federated Identity Credential that trusts all branches." />
