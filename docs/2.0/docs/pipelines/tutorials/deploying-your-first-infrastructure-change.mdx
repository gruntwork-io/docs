In this tutorial, we will guide you through deploying cloud storage. This "hello world" example introduces Gruntwork Pipelines and lays the groundwork for using it in production environments.

## What you'll get

By the end of this tutorial, you will have:

- Cloud storage deployed automatically using Gruntwork Pipelines:
  - **AWS**: An S3 bucket
  - **Azure**: A Resource Group and Storage Account

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- Pipelines installed in a GitHub or GitLab repository. Refer to [Setup & Installation](/2.0/docs/pipelines/installation/overview) for more details.
- Access to a sandbox or development cloud environment (AWS account or Azure subscription) configured during the Pipelines installation process.
- Permissions to create a pull request in the GitHub/GitLab repository where Pipelines is installed.

## Running Your first pipeline

This section covers creating a cloud storage resource using Pipelines and GitOps workflows. You will define a `terragrunt.hcl` file to create storage, push the changes, create a pull/merge request to trigger a `plan` action, and merge the request to run an `apply` action that creates the resource.

### Adding cloud storage

:::caution Permissions Required

By default, Pipelines is configured with the permissions needed to complete this tutorial. However, depending on your specific setup, you may need to adjust the IAM roles used by Pipelines to ensure they have the necessary permissions.

The default Pipelines role has permissions to create S3 buckets with names that start with `test-pipelines-`. If you want to use a different bucket name, you may need to update the IAM policy accordingly.

:::tip
The default `bootstrap` Terragrunt stack provided in the installation guide includes `plan_iam_policy` and `apply_iam_policy` values that can be configured to adjust the permissions granted to Pipelines.
:::

:::

1. Create the folder structure for the new S3 bucket in your environment. Replace <CustomizableValue id="ACCOUNT_NAME" /> with the account name you are deploying to and <CustomizableValue id="REGION" /> with the AWS region where the S3 bucket will be deployed.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p $$ACCOUNT_NAME$$/$$REGION$$/data-storage/s3
   touch $$ACCOUNT_NAME$$/$$REGION$$/region.hcl
   touch $$ACCOUNT_NAME$$/$$REGION$$/data-storage/s3/terragrunt.hcl
   ```

2. Add the following content to the `region.hcl` file created earlier.

   ```hcl title="$$ACCOUNT_NAME$$/$$REGION$$/region.hcl"
   locals {
     aws_region = "$$REGION$$"
   }
   ```

3. Add the Terragrunt code below to the newly created `terragrunt.hcl` file to define the S3 bucket. Replace <CustomizableValue id='S3_BUCKET_NAME'/> with your desired bucket name. Ensure the bucket name is unique.

   ```hcl title="$$ACCOUNT_NAME$$/$$REGION$$/data-storage/s3/terragrunt.hcl"
   # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   # DEPLOY GRUNTWORK's S3-BUCKET MODULE
   # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   terraform {
     source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog.git//modules/data-stores/s3-bucket?ref=v0.116.1"
   }

   include "root" {
     path = find_in_parent_folders("root.hcl")
   }

   inputs = {
     primary_bucket = "$$S3_BUCKET_NAME$$"
   }
   ```

:::caution Permissions Required

By default, Pipelines is configured with the permissions needed to complete this tutorial. However, depending on your specific setup, you may need to adjust the role used by Pipelines to ensure it has the appropriate permissions to create Resource Groups and Storage Accounts in your subscription.

:::tip
The default `bootstrap` Terragrunt stack provided in the installation guide includes `plan_custom_role_actions` and `apply_custom_role_actions` values that can be configured to adjust the permissions granted to Pipelines.
:::

:::

1. Create the folder structure for the new Resource Group and Storage Account in your environment. Replace <CustomizableValue id="SUBSCRIPTION_NAME" /> with the subscription name you are deploying to, <CustomizableValue id="LOCATION" /> with the Azure location where the resources will be deployed, and <CustomizableValue id="RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME" /> with your desired resource group name.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p $$SUBSCRIPTION_NAME$$/$$LOCATION$$/resource-groups/$$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME$$/resource-group
   mkdir -p $$SUBSCRIPTION_NAME$$/$$LOCATION$$/resource-groups/$$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME$$/data-storage/storage-account
   touch $$SUBSCRIPTION_NAME$$/$$LOCATION$$/region.hcl
   touch $$SUBSCRIPTION_NAME$$/$$LOCATION$$/resource-groups/$$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME$$/resource-group/terragrunt.hcl
   touch $$SUBSCRIPTION_NAME$$/$$LOCATION$$/resource-groups/$$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME$$/data-storage/storage-account/terragrunt.hcl
   ```

2. Add the following content to the `region.hcl` file created earlier.

   ```hcl title="$$SUBSCRIPTION_NAME$$/$$LOCATION$$/region.hcl"
   locals {
     azure_location = "$$LOCATION$$"
   }
   ```

3. Add the Terragrunt code below to define the Resource Group.

   ```hcl title="$$SUBSCRIPTION_NAME$$/$$LOCATION$$/resource-groups/$$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME$$/resource-group/terragrunt.hcl"
   # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   # DEPLOY GRUNTWORK's AZURE RESOURCE GROUP MODULE
   # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   include "root" {
     path = find_in_parent_folders("root.hcl")
   }

   terraform {
     source = "github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//modules/azure/resource-group?ref=v1.1.0"
   }

   inputs = {
     name     = "$$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME$$"
     location = "$$LOCATION$$"
   }
   ```

4. Add the Terragrunt code below to define the Storage Account with a dependency on the Resource Group. Replace <CustomizableValue id='STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME'/> with your desired storage account name. Ensure the name is unique and follows Azure naming conventions (lowercase letters and numbers only, 3-24 characters).

   ```hcl title="$$SUBSCRIPTION_NAME$$/$$LOCATION$$/resource-groups/$$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME$$/data-storage/storage-account/terragrunt.hcl"
   # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   # DEPLOY GRUNTWORK's AZURE STORAGE ACCOUNT MODULE
   # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   include "root" {
     path = find_in_parent_folders("root.hcl")
   }

   terraform {
     source = "github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//modules/azure/storage-account?ref=v1.1.0"
   }

   dependency "resource_group" {
     config_path = "../../resource-group"

     mock_outputs = {
       name = "mock-name"
     }
   }

   inputs = {
     name     = "$$STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME$$"
     location = "$$LOCATION$$"

     resource_group_name = dependency.resource_group.outputs.name
   }
   ```

### Planning the changes

<Tabs groupId="platform">
<TabItem value="github" label="GitHub" groupId="scm" default>

1. Create a new branch for your changes.
2. Commit the changes to your branch and push it.
3. Create a pull request (PR) against `main` (the default branch in your repository). Refer to this [GitHub tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for instructions on creating a PR.

After creating the PR, GitHub Actions will automatically execute the workflow defined in `/.github/workflows/pipelines.yml` in your repository.

Once the workflow completes, Pipelines will post a comment on the PR summarizing the `terragrunt plan` output along with a link to the GitHub Actions workflow logs.
