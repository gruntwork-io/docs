# Starting point

We follow [the official HashiCorp style guide](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/style.html) for Terraform.

All of these are enforced using `terraform fmt`. All Gruntwork Terraform repos should enforce this using pre-commit
hooks; please add if missing.

On top of the official guide, Gruntwork follows some additional conventions.
