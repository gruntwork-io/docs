## Dockerfile Tips

Some things to note when writing up your `Dockerfile` and building your app:

- Ensure your `Dockerfile` starts your app in the foreground so the container doesnâ€™t shutdown after app startup.

- Your app should log to `stdout`/`stderr` to aid in debugging it after deployment to GKE.
