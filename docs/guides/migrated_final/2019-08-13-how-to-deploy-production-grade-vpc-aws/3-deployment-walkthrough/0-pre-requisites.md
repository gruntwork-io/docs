# Pre-requisites

This walkthrough has the following pre-requisites:

Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library  
This guide uses code from the [Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library](https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/), as it
implements most of the production-grade design for you out of the box. Make sure to read
[How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library](/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library).

You must be a <span className="js-subscribe-cta">Gruntwork subscriber</span> to access the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library.

Terraform  
This guide uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to define and manage all the infrastructure as code. If youâ€™re
not familiar with Terraform, check out [A
Comprehensive Guide to Terraform](https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-terraform-b3d32832baca), [A Crash Course on Terraform](https://training.gruntwork.io/p/terraform), and
[How to Use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library](/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library)

AWS accounts  
This guide deploys infrastructure into one or more AWS accounts. Check out the
[Production Grade AWS Account Structure](/guides/foundations/how-to-configure-production-grade-aws-account-structure) guide for instructions.
You will also need to be able to authenticate to these accounts on the CLI: check out
[A Comprehensive Guide to Authenticating to AWS on the Command Line](https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-authenticating-to-aws-on-the-command-line-63656a686799)
for instructions.
