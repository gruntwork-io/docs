# Profiles

The Benchmark defines two profile levels. Level one recommendations are easier to implement, incur less
overhead, but still substantially improve security. Level two recommendations are meant for highly sensitive
environments with a lower risk appetite. They may be more difficult to implement and/or cause more overhead in
day-to-day usage.
