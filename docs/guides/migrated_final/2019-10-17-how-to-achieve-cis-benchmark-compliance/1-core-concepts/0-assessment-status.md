## Assessment Status

Each recommendation is classified as either _Automated_ or _Manual_. _Automated_ recommendations indicate that
the check for the recommendation may be accessed programmatically (e.g., an API exists to validate or enable
the recommendation). _Manual_ recommendations must be checked and remediated manually.
