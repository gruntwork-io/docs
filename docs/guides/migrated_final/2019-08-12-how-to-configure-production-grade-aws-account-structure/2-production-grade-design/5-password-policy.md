## Password policy

In any account that has IAM users (which should just be the root and security accounts), configure a password policy
that ensures all IAM users have strong passwords. The exact policy you use depends on your companyâ€™s requirements (e.g.,
certain compliance requirements may force you to use a specific password policy), but you may want to consider
[NIST 800-63 guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecret) as a reasonable starting point.
