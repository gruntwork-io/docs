## What is Kubernetes?

[Kubernetes (K8S)](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source system for managing containerized applications, including:

Scheduling  
Deploy containers across a cluster of servers, using the available resources (data centers, servers, CPU, memory,
ports, etc.) as efficiently as possible.

Deployments  
Roll out updates to containers using a variety of deployment strategies, such as rolling deployment, blue-green
deployment, and canary deployment, and automatically roll back if there’s an error.

Auto healing  
Monitor the health of your containers and servers and automatically replace unhealthy ones.

Auto scaling  
Scale the number of containers and servers up or down in response to load.

Load balancing  
Make your containers accessible to the outside world and distribute traffic across your containers.

Service discovery  
Allow containers to find and communicate with each other over the network, automatically routing requests to the
proper destination.

Configuration and secrets  
Provide containers with environment-specific configuration data and secrets.
