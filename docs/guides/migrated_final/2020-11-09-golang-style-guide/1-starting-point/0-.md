# Starting point

We use the excellent [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guide as the starting point for our style
guide. **Unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, we default to following the conventions outlined in Effective Go.**

Another helpful resource is the [CodeReviewComments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) section of the
Go GitHub wiki page.

Below you will find the list of conventions that differ from the above mentioned documents, either because they are
specific to Gruntwork, or because we consciously chose to go against what Effective Go and CodeReviewComments recommend.
