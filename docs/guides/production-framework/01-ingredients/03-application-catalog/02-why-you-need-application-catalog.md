# Why you need an Application Catalog

1. **Designed for use directly in production**. Many of the web frameworks and libraries that you find in the wild seem to be full of code that's great for a "5 minute demo"—something that looks great in a sales presentation—but isn't actually useful for real-world production use cases. The sort of Application Catalog we're talking about here *should be explicitly built to be used directly in production*.
2. **Designed to meet your company's requirements**. In order to be able to use your Application Catalog in production, it should be written *specifically to meet your company's requirements out-of-the-box* (the ones you defined in the first section). This includes requirements around security, compliance, reliability, monitoring, and everything else it takes to build a production-grade cloud-native app. This works hand-in-hand with the Service Catalog, which is designed to meet your company's requirements from the infrastructure perspective, whereas the Application Catalog is designed to meet your company's requirements from the application perspective.
3. **Vetted, approved patterns**. Developers love to try out new languages, frameworks, and tools, and while that can be a lot of fun, in a company setting, that can be harmful (see also: [Choose Boring Technology](http://boringtechnology.club/)). Creating an official Application Catalog in your company makes it explicit which languages and frameworks have been vetted and approved and already have many problems solved out-of-the-box. If a developer wants to try out new libraries, they of course can, but if they want to introduce an entirely new programming language or framework into the company, they now have to first add it to the Application Catalog, and ensure it solves all the problems the existing languages and frameworks have already solved. This is good in two senses: it makes it clear and explicit what your languages and frameworks must be able to do to be allowed in production and, by making all those requirements more visible, it reduces the odds that someone tries to put something in prod that does not meet your company's requirements.
4. **Useful for greenfield and brownfield**. An Application Catalog can be useful for building brand new applications ("greenfield"), where you might build directly on top of a template or framework in the Application Catalog, as well as for updating existing applications ("brownfield") to work well in the cloud, where you might incorporate individual libraries and patterns into those apps.
