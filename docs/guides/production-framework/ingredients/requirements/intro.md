# Requirements

Here's a fun experiment to try at your company: go around to 5 different teams, and ask them, "what do I have to do to
put a new app in prod?" In most companies, you'll get 5 (or sometimes even 6!) completely different answers. One team
might talk about packaging your app using Docker; another may talk about configuring monitoring, logging, and alerting;
another team will focus on what compliance and regulatory requirements you must meet; yet another team will dive into
the details of your scalability and high availability requirements.

As Yogi Berra said, if you don't know where you are going, you'll end up someplace else. Something similar is true of
the cloud: if you don't know *exactly* what your cloud requirements are, you won't meet them. Trying to backfill
security, compliance, monitoring, availability, and other requirements *after* your team has been running wild in the
cloud for months is much harder.

From working with hundreds of companies, we've found that make successful use of the cloud, you need to:

1. [Define your requirements in writing](define-requirements-in-writing.md).
2. [Implement your requirements inc ode](implement-requirements-in-code.md).
