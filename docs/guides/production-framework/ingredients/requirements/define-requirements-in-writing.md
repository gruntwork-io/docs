# Define requirements in writing

There is a power to getting your requirements down in writing, especially in the form of a checklist (see also:
*The Checklist Manifesto*). You get a real sense of the work involvedâ€”seeing a long list of requirements, in front of
you, on (digital) paper, makes the scope of the work much more visible, which is particularly useful in the face of
bosses who blindly demand "we must be 100% in the cloud by *&lt;unrealistic timeline&gt;*!!!" with zero context on just
how much work is involved. You can use the list of requirements to coordinate the work and track progress towards. You
can use this list not only for an initial launch, but for all new deployments in the future too. You can of course
include diagrams and images too. And when you put it all together, you'll finally have a single, canonical, written
answer to "what do I have to do to put a new app in prod?"

There are many types of requirements to take into consideration:

| Requirement                   | Examples                                       |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Infrastructure                | Servers, databases, load balancers, etc.       |
| Compliance                    | SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI, CIS, etc.        |
| Observability                 | Metrics, logging, alerting, audit trails, etc. |
| Governance                    | Operations, access control, data mgmt, etc.    |
| Security                      | Encryption, secrets management, auth, etc.     |
| Scalability                   | Load, throughput, response time, etc.          |
| Availability &amp; resiliency | SLAs, backup, replication, etc.                |
| Cost                          | Budget, cost tracking, cost optimization, etc. |

This list is just a starting point; depending on your company's needs, there may be other requirements to take into
account. The good news is that once you start getting these down systematically, in writing, you'll realize what else
you need to think through as well.
