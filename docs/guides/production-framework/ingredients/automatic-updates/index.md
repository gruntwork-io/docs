# Automatic Updates

The software world is constantly changing: the cloud vendors we use (e.g., AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud) release
thousands of updates per year; the tools we use (e.g., Kubernetes, Helm, Docker, Terraform, Serverless, Edge) are
constantly evolving; there are new processes, techniques, and best practices (e.g., DevOps, DevSecOps, Agile, Scrum,
Kanban, SRE, GitOps, ChatOps) being developed all the time; and there are new security vulnerabilities to patch every
day.

It's not enough to just set up the previous ingredients; you also need an automatic updates solution to keep
everything up-to-date, so that all your hard work doesn't turn into tech debt.
