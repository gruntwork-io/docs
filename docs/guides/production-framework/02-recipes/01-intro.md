# Recipes

Let's now put all the ingredients together into a recipe and walk through what the experience will look like for your
Dev team and Ops team if your company implements the framework outlined in this guide. Please bear in mind that there
are many ways to combine these ingredients, so this particular recipe is just one example of how all these pieces can
work together, but hopefully, it gives you a pretty good idea of what to aim for.
