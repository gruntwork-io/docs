# How we version code

## Versioning

All of the code in the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library is _versioned_. Every time we make a change, we put out a new
versioned release, and announce it in the periodical
[Gruntwork Newsletter](https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter).

### Pinned Versions

When you use the code from the Gruntwork IaC Library, you pin yourself to a specific version of the code. That way 
you are not accidentally affected by any subsequent changes in the Gruntwork IaC Library until you explicitly choose to
pull those changes in. When you do want to pull the changes in, be sure to read through the release notes for any 
migration steps you need to take and then bump the version number accordingly.

### Semantic Versioning

We use version numbers of the form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`), following the principles of
_[semantic versioning](https://semver.org)_. In traditional semantic versioning, you increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make backward incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes.

However, much of the Gruntwork IaC Library is still pre-`1.0.0`. Most of the Gruntwork IaC Library uses 
`0.MINOR.PATCH` version numbers. With `0.MINOR.PATCH`, the rules are a bit different, where you increment the:

1. MINOR version when you make backward incompatible API changes, and
2. PATCH version when you add backward compatible functionality or bug fixes.

### What changes are backward incompatible?

In the world of DevOps, we've inherited our view of toil, and that continues to describe what DevOps engineers expect 
as part of their daily grunt work. However with IaC, we can liberate ourselves from that thinking and automate more of 
the toil than before, and as automation and infrastructure APIs improve, we can expect much more of DevOps grunt work 
to become automated. What we think of as necessary toil is constantly evolving, so how we define our releases (i.e., 
backward compatible or not) is also subject to this evolution.

We (Gruntwork) currently consider the following types of updates backward incompatible:

1. Any update that requires some toil by the user. This is a moving target. At the moment, actions like bumping a
version number are not considered toil, but actions like running migration steps that modify Terraform state are
considered toil. In the near future, bumping a version number could be toil, and we are working to remove the need
for users to do that.

2. Any update that requires configuration changes by the user. When we release a new MINOR version in pre-`1.0.0`, we 
include a migration guide with explicit steps you can take to resolve the backward incompatibilities, such that the 
update becomes backward compatible for you. 

3. Any update that incurs downtime for you. This includes changes that require recreating a resource that may be in 
use. Even if the update attempts to first create the new resource and then destroy the existing resource, the order of
apply may not be guaranteed, and there could still be downtime during the hand-off.

4. Most updates that destroy resources. There are some cases where destroying resources is necessary and will not incur 
downtime, such as `null_resource`s that only exist as a stop-gap for something missing in the AWS API or the Terraform
AWS provider API.

We try to err on the side of caution. Sometimes we release an update as MINOR even if it is functionally backward 
compatible. For example, the [AWS Provider v4 update](/guides/stay-up-to-date/terraform/how-to-update-to-aws-provider-v4)
requires no configuration changes in Gruntwork module usage. It requires unlocking the provider version maintained in 
the `terraform.lock.hcl` file, which makes it somewhat backward incompatible. Additionally it may still require you to 
update any infrastructure code which does not use Gruntwork modules. Because this upgrade requires some vigilance, we 
released it as a MINOR version increase to signal importance.

We're working to provide automatic resolution with patches, i.e., scripts that you can run when bumping your versions,
so that `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` result in clean updates. These releases would still be considered
backward incompatible because they require running a patch, could cause downtime, or could change resources 
significantly.

## Updating to new versions

:::caution

In general, update one MINOR at a time, paying close attention to the release notes for migration steps. A MINOR 
version number increase (e.g., `v0.18.0` → `v0.19.0`) signals a backward incompatible change, and the release 
notes will contain a migration guide explaining what you need to do (e.g., update the configuration by adding, 
removing, or changing variables you pass to the module).

:::

Follow the steps below to keep your code up to date:

1.  Make sure you're following our [Gruntwork Newsletter](https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter)
    to be notified of all updates to the Gruntwork IaC Library. Alternatively, you can watch repos in GitHub that 
    you’re interested in. If you use the Reference Architecture, you could watch the Service Catalog repos.

2.  When you find an update you’d like for a specific module, update module sources referencing that module in your 
    Terraform code to the new version number. For example, if you were using `terraform-aws-vpc` at `v0.18.5` and you
    wanted to update to `v0.18.6`, you would change from:

    ```hcl
    module "vpc" {
      source = "git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc.git//modules/vpc-app?ref=v0.18.5"
      # ...
    }
    ```

    to:

    ```hcl
    module "vpc" {
      source = "git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc.git//modules/vpc-app?ref=v0.18.6"
      # ...
    }
    ```

    One way you can do this quickly is by stringing together commands using `ripgrep`, `xargs`, and `sed`, or any other
    method that allows find-and-replace operations within a directory.

3.  Optionally, test your changes locally. Use the same process outlined in 
    [Manual tests for Terraform code](/intro/first-deployment/testing#manual-tests-for-terraform-code) and
    [Automated tests for Terraform code](/intro/first-deployment/testing#automated-tests-for-terraform-code).

4.  Deploy your changes to each environment. Use `terraform plan` to sanity-check the changes before `terraform apply`.
    Use the same process outlined in [Deploying Terraform code](#deploy_terraform).
