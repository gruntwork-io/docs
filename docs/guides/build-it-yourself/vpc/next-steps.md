# Next steps

Now that you have your management and application VPCs deployed, you can start building the rest of your infrastructure
on top of them! Typically, the best next step is to deploy a cluster of servers for running your applications by using
one of the following guides:

- [How to deploy a production-grade Kubernetes cluster on AWS](/docs/guides/build-it-yourself/kubernetes-cluster/)
- `How to deploy a production grade ECS cluster on AWS` _(coming soon!)_
- `How to deploy a production grade Nomad cluster on AWS` _(coming soon!)_
- `How to deploy a production grade Auto Scaling Group on AWS` _(coming soon!)_

If youâ€™re not sure which of these options to use, check out the `Server Cluster Comparison` guide _(coming soon!)_.
