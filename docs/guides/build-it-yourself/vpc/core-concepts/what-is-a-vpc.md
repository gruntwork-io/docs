# What is a VPC?

If you were building your own data center, you would set up a _physical network_ by configuring switches, routers,
connecting everything with ethernet cables, and so on. In the AWS cloud, you can set up a _virtual network_ (AKA a
software-defined network) by configuring a [_Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)_](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/). Each VPC defines
a logical partition of your AWS account, complete with its own IP addresses, subnets, routing rules, and firewalls.

The VPC serves three primary purposes:

#### Networking

The VPC is the basic networking and communication layer for your AWS account. Just about every AWS resource (e.g.,
EC2 instances, RDS databases, ELBs, etc) runs in a VPC and the VPC determines how (or if) all those resources are
able to talk to each other.

#### Security

The VPC is also the basic security layer for your AWS account. As it controls all networking and communication,
itâ€™s your first line of defense against attackers, protecting your resources from unwanted access.

#### Partitioning

VPCs also give you a way to create separate, logical partitions within an AWS account. For example, you could have
one VPC for a staging environment and a separate VPC for a production environment. You can also connect VPCs to
other networks, such as connecting your VPC to your corporate intranet via a VPN connection, so that everyone in
your office and all the resources in your AWS account can access the same IPs and domain names.
