# Use EKS

We recommend using [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) to run Kubernetes in AWS. It manages the control plane
for you, which significantly reduces your operational burden; it has good integration with other AWS services; you can
manage it entirely as code; and while EKS still has some gaps in terms of features, and is more complicated to use than
it should be, AWS seems to be heavily investing into the service, so any small benefits you get from using other
solutions will most likely be eclipsed very quickly by future EKS releases.
