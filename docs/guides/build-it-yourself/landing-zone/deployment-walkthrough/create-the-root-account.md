the central place where you manage billing. You create this initial account manually, via a web browser:

1. Go to [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com).

2. Click Create an AWS Account.

3. Go through the sign up flow, entering contact and billing details as requested.

4. You will be asked to enter an email address and password to use as the credentials for the root user of this root
    account.
