# IAM users

In AWS, you use _[Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)_ to manage access to your AWS
account. One of the things you can do in IAM is create an
_[IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html)_, which is an account a human being can use
to access AWS.



<div className="dlist">

#### User name

Every IAM user in your AWS account must have a unique _user name_.

#### Console password

Each IAM user can optionally have a _console password_. The user name and console password allows you to login as an
IAM user to your AWS account in a web browser by using the IAM user sign-in URL.

#### IAM user sign-in URL

Every AWS account has a unique
_[IAM user sign-in URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_how-users-sign-in.html)_. Note
that to login as an IAM user, you do NOT go to <https://console.aws.amazon.com>, as thatâ€™s solely the sign-in URL for
root users. Instead, IAM users will need to use a sign-in URL of the form
`\https://<ID_OR_ALIAS>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`, where `ID_OR_ALIAS` is either your AWS account ID (e.g.,
`\https://111122223333.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`) or a
_[custom account alias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html)_ that you pick for
your AWS account (e.g., `\https://my-custom-alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`). Whenever you create a new IAM
user, make sure to send that IAM user their user name, console password, and the IAM user sign-in URL.

#### Access keys

Each IAM user can optionally have a set of
_[access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys)_,
which are the credentials you use to login to your AWS account programmatically (e.g., on the command line or when
making API calls). Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`) and a
secret access key (for example, `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`).

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Each IAM user can enable
[Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html) (**strongly
recommended**), which will require you to provide not only the user name and console password when logging in, but
also a temporary, one-time token generated by either a virtual or physical MFA device (e.g., the Google Authenticator
app, RSA key fob, or a YubiKey). This adds a strong second layer of security for your IAM user, as logging in now
requires both something you know (the user name and password) and something you have (the virtual or physical MFA
device).

#### Password policy

You can configure a
_[password policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.html)_
in your AWS account to enforce requirements on console passwords, such as minimum length, use of special characters,
and password expiration.

#### Permissions

By default, a new IAM user does not have permissions to do anything in the AWS account
([principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)). In order to grant this
user permissions, you will need to use IAM policies, which are the topic of the next section.
