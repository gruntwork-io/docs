# CIS Compliance Core Concepts

The CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark is organized into the following sections:

- Identity and Access Management
- Storage
- Logging
- Monitoring
- Networking

There are multiple recommendations within each section. Note the use of the term _recommendation_ as opposed
to _control_ or _requirement_. This reinforces the point that CIS is a self-imposed, best-practices standard,
as opposed to compulsory or regulated and centralized standards such as the
[PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) for the payment card industry or
[HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html) for covered
health care entities.
