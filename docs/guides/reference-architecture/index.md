# The Gruntwork Reference Architecture

The Reference Architecture is an opinionated, battle-tested, best-practices way to assemble the code from the Infrastructure as Code Library into an end-to-end tech stack that includes just about everything you need: server cluster, load balancer, database, cache, network topology, monitoring, alerting, CI/CD, secrets management, VPN, and more. We generate the Reference Architecture based on your needs, deploy into your AWS accounts, and give you 100% of the code.

If you've purchased a Reference Architecture, these guides will help guide you through the process of choosing your configuration as well as deploying your apps and services. If you haven't but would like to, contact [sales@gruntwork.io](mailto:sales@gruntwork.io).
