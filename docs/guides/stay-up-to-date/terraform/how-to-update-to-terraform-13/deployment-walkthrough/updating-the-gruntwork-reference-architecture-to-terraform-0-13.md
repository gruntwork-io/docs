# Updating the Gruntwork Reference Architecture to Terraform 0.13

If you purchased the Gruntwork Reference Architecture, you will have a copy of
the `infrastructure-live` and `infrastructure-modules` repositories that contain
the infrastructure code for deploying the Reference Architecture. You will need
to update the relevant code in `infrastructure-modules` to use a compatible
version of the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library, as per [the
compatibility
table](step-3-update-references-to-the-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library.md#version-compatibility-table)
above.

To help guide you through the upgrade process, we have updated the Acme
Reference Architecture examples to support Terraform 0.13. You can refer to the
pull requests to see an example of the updates youâ€™ll need to do to make your
Reference Architecture work with Terraform 0.13:
