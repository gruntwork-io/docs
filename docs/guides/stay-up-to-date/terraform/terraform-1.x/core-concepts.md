From the [release
notes](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v1.0.0):

> Terraform v1.0.0 intentionally has no significant changes compared to
> Terraform v0.15.5. You can consider the v1.0 series as a direct continuation of
> the v0.15 series; we do not intend to issue any further releases in the v0.15
> series, because all of the v1.0 releases will be only minor updates to address
> bugs.
