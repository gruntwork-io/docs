# Update to Terraform 1.x

This guide will walk you through how to update any code that depends on the
[Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code
Library](https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/) to [Terraform
1.x](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/1-0.html). Terraform v1.0 is an
unusual release in that its primary focus is on stability. Terraform v1.0.0
intentionally has no significant changes compared to Terraform v0.15.5. You can
consider the v1.0 series as a direct continuation of the v0.15 series.

# What youâ€™ll learn in this guide

This guide consists of two main sections:

<div className="dlist">

#### [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md)

An overview of Terraform 1.x.

#### [Deployment walkthrough](deployment-walkthrough/step-1-update-your-code-to-be-compatible-with-terraform-0-15.md)

The steps you need to take to update your code relying on the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code library to work with
Terraform 1.x. Includes a
[version compatibility table](deployment-walkthrough/step-2-update-references-to-the-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library.md#version-compatibility-table) you can use as a reference to know which Gruntwork Repo version
tag is compatible with Terraform 1.x.
