# Update to Terraform 1.1

This guide will walk you through how to update any code that depends on the
[Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code
Library](https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/) to [Terraform
1.1](https://www.terraform.io/language/upgrade-guides/1-1). Terraform v1.1 has
no backwards incompatible changes compared with Terraform v1.0.

# What youâ€™ll learn in this guide

This guide consists of two main sections:

<div className="dlist">

#### [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md)

An overview of Terraform 1.1.

#### [Deployment walkthrough](deployment-walkthrough/step-1-update-your-code-to-be-compatible-with-terraform-1-x.md)

The steps you need to take to update your code relying on the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code library to work with
Terraform 1.1. Includes a
[version compatibility table](deployment-walkthrough/step-2-update-references-to-the-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library.md#version-compatibility-table) you can use as a reference to know which Gruntwork Repo version
tag is compatible with Terraform 1.1.
