# Intro

This guide will walk you through how to update any code that depends on the
[Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code
Library](https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/) to [Terraform
0.15](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-15.html). Terraform 0.15
introduces several new features and fixes, but it also has a number of backwards
incompatibilities that have to be incorporated into your codebase.

# What youâ€™ll learn in this guide

This guide consists of two main sections:

<div className="dlist">

#### [Core Concepts](1-core-concepts.md)

An overview of Terraform 0.15 and why it is important to update your code for compatibility.

#### [Deployment walkthrough](2-deployment-walkthrough/0-step-1-update-your-code-to-be-compatible-with-terraform-0-14.md)

The steps you need to take to update your code relying on the Gruntwork
Infrastructure as Code library to work with Terraform 0.15. Includes a [version
compatibility
table](2-deployment-walkthrough/2-step-3-update-references-to-the-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library.md#version-compatibility-table)
you can use as a reference to know which Gruntwork Repo version tag is
compatible with Terraform 0.15.
