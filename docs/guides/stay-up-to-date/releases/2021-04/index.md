- **Terraform 0.14 upgrade**: We have verified that this repo is compatible with Terraform `0.14.x`! 
    - From this release onward, we will only be running tests with Terraform `0.14.x` against this repo, so we recommend updating to `0.14.x` soon! 
    - To give you more time to upgrade, for the time being, all modules will still support Terraform `0.12.26` and above, as that version has several features in it (`required_providers` with `source` URLs) that make it more forwards compatible with `0.14.x`. 
    - Once all Gruntwork repos have been upgrade to work with `0.14.x`, we will publish a migration guide with a version compatibility table and announce it all via the Gruntwork Newsletter.
- Many other bug fixes and improvements, including:
    - Bump to latest Service Catalog version
    - Enable encryption by default in a few places where it wasn't enabled already
    - A number of CI / CD and Jenkins fixes
    - Switch to `main` branch from `master`
    - Update internal references to the new repo naming scheme
    - Many documentation improvements
    - A few test fixes

- Fix health check and timeout settings for the target groups created by `ecs-service`. Depending on the protocol you're using (e.g., TCP, UDP, TLS, etc), only certain values are permitted. The AWS docs are unclear on this, but we've done our best to implement the required rules.

Remove `var.environment_name` from `ecs-service` and `ecs-daemon-service`. This was only used to name the IAM resources created within the modules, but was confusingly named. The functionality of the variable has been replaced with the following three, targeted variables:

- `var.custom_iam_role_name_prefix` for the IAM role used by the ECS tasks.
- `var.custom_task_execution_name_prefix` for the IAM role used by ECS to spawn the tasks.
- `var.custom_ecs_service_role_name` for the IAM role used by the ECS service to access load balancers.

Refer to the migration guide to avoid recreating the IAM roles when updating to this release.

   - You can now configure the name of the Target Group using the `target_group_name` in the object passed to the `server_ports` input. This is useful when migrating an existing target group into the service catalog module.
- Adding module-level flags to allow enabling or disabling of `aws-config`, `iam-groups`, `iam-cross-account-roles` modules. The default value of the `enable_*` flags is set to true, so using or calling these modules is not expected to change.
- Add variable validation to `alb_name` to guard against the limit of 32 characters for ALB names
- Fix bug in `ec2-baseline` where it incorrectly detected that `dpkg` was not available.
- Add sensible defaults for `ssh_grunt_iam_group` and `ssh_grunt_iam_group_sudo` to the `bastion-host` and `jenkins` modules.
- You can now configure a `PodDisruptionBudget` for your Kubernetes service deployed with the `k8s-service` module using the `min_number_of_pods_available` input variable.

Allows wildcard domains to be passed in the `subject_alternative_names`, making it easier to request a single ACM certificate that protects both the apex domain (`example.com`) AND the first level of subdomains (`*.example.com`). To achieve this, request `example.com` in the key of your `var.public_zones` map and pass `*.example.com` in the `subject_alternative_names` list for the same entry: 

```
public_zones = {
       "example.com" = {
           comment = "You can add arbitrary text here"
           tags = {
              Foo = "bar"

           force_destroy = true

           }
       }
  }
```

**NOTE**: Starting this release, it is no longer possible to disable the creation of ACM certificates on the domains that are managed by the module. We introduced back the ability to disable ACM certificate creation in [v0.44.5](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/releases/tag/v0.44.5). It is advised to upgrade to at least that version if you want to avoid managing ACM certificates in this module.

- `account-baseline-app` now has the option to automatically deploy the `iam-access-analyzer-multi-region` module inline with the other account baselines. Note: this is disabled by default.
adds a number of conditional variables to the App Account Baseline in order to override the creation of resources with their CIS-compatible variants.

- Update dependency gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks to v0.35.1 (was `v0.33.1`). **This is a backward incompatible change.** This update renames the default Fargate Execution IAM role that gets created by the `eks-cluster-control-plane` module. To avoid recreating the IAM role, you need to configure `custom_default_fargate_iam_role_name` to be `&lt;CLUSTER_NAME&gt;-default-fargate-execution-role`.
- Update dependency gruntwork-io/terragrunt to v0.28.19

</p>

<div style={{"overflow":"hidden","textOverflow":"ellipsis","display":"-webkit-box","WebkitLineClamp":10,"lineClamp":10,"WebkitBoxOrient":"vertical"}}>

  

- Several bug fixes in the `ecs-cluster` module:
    - Remove unused variables (`allow_requests_from_public_alb`, `include_internal_alb`, `enable_cloudwatch_alarms`). If you were configuring these, you will need to remove them from your module call.
    - `enable_ecs_cloudwatch_alarms`, `enable_cloudwatch_metrics`, and `enable_cloudwatch_log_aggregation` now default to `true` like all the other modules in the Service Catalog. Set to `false` if you were using the default values.
    - Remove redundant cloudwatch logs aggregation IAM policy attachment.

- Update dependency gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-monitoring to v0.26.1
- Add ability to specify the encryption configuration for the images in the ECR repo
- Update dependency gruntwork-io/kubergrunt to v0.6.11
- Update dependency gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security to v0.46.4
- Update dependency gruntwork-io/terratest to v0.32.21
