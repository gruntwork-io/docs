# Finally

And that’s all, fellow Gruntworkers.

This guide is meant to help you get your AWS infrastructure from CIS 1.3.0 to CIS 1.4.0 using our dedicated and up-to-date modules. While we try to automate as much as possible, some of the steps are still manual. We hope that the guide above clearly details what needs to be done, and how.

If you’ve got any feedback or you think something’s missing from the guide, please get in touch via one of the [support options](/docs/guides/support).
