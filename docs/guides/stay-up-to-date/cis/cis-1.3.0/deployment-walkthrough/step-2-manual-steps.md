# Step 2: Manual steps

Recommendation 4.15 requires an active subscriber for the SNS topic created by this recommendation (see Audit steps 6
and 7 for 4.15). As it’s impossible to automate this subscriber’s creation, you’ll have to do so manually. See
[Subscribing to an Amazon SNS topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.html)
on the AWS website for detailed instructions.
