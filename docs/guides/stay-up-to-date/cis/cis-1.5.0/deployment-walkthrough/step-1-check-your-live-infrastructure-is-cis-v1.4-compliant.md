# Step 1: Check your live infrastructure is CIS v1.4 compliant

The later steps in this guide assume that you are upgrading from CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.4 to v1.5.

Before you update to CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.5, we strongly recommend that you confirm that your existing live infrastructure is compliant with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.4.

If you do not have existing tooling in place to confirm this, then we suggest that you run the [Steampipe CIS v1.4.0](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_compliance/controls/benchmark.cis_v140) check against your infrastructure.

In the final step in this guide, we suggest you run Steampipe to verify that your infrastructure is CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.5 compliant.
