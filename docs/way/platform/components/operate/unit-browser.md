# Unit Browser

**How to browse what infrastructure is deployed**

A unit browser lets you explore your infrastructure at the level of abstraction that matters to your organization. Rather than just listing cloud resources, it shows the meaningful entities your teams care about.

## Why it matters

Without a unit browser, understanding what's deployed requires piecing together information from multiple sources and translating low-level cloud resources into high-level concepts.

## What it enables

- Quick understanding of deployed infrastructure
- Discovery of infrastructure ownership
- Search and filtering by relevant attributes
- Understanding relationships between infrastructure units
