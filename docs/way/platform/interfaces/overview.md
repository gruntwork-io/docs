# Interfaces

Your developer platform should be accessible through multiple interfaces to meet developers where they work. Different workflows and user personas benefit from different interaction modes, and providing multiple interfaces ensures your platform can serve the diverse needs of your organization.

## Web UI

The Web UI works well when developers want to browse the catalog, discover what infrastructure is deployed, or configure patterns through guided self-service workflows. It excels at discoverability and reducing cognitive load for teams new to your platform or performing infrequent tasks.

## CLI

The CLI works well when developers want to interact with your platform directly from their terminal, where much of their work already happens. It's ideal for power users who need speed, scriptability, and integration into local development workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

## API

The API works well when you need programmatic access to your platform's capabilities for integrating with other systems and automating at scale. It's essential for orchestrating multiple platform operations, building custom tooling, and enabling other systems to interact with your infrastructure.

## AI/MCP

The AI interface, including support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), works well when developers want to interact with your platform using natural language. It reduces the learning curve and provides contextual help, making your platform more accessible to developers of all experience levels.
