# Enable developer self-service

The ideal velocity for application developers is that they get the infrastructure they need, when they need it, without human gatekeepers. This known as **developer self-service.**

To achieve developer self-service, application developers need:

- A [catalog](/docs/way/platform/components/deploy/catalog) of patterns to choose from
- A way to [configure a pattern](/docs/way/platform/components/deploy/runbooks)
- A way to [deploy the pattern](/docs/way/platform/components/deploy/pipelines)
- A way to [monitor the pattern instance](/docs/way/platform/components/operate/registry)
- A way to [update or delete the pattern instance](/docs/way/platform/components/operate/unit-browser)

As you can see, developer self-service is highly valuable, but also hard to get right.
