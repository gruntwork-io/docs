# Make good practices the default

Developers want to focus on their application, not compliance, reliability, cost management, or any other number of governance and maintainability concerns. So they generally _won't_ invest in these areas unless they are forced to.

But as a platform engineer, you can build in compliance, security, and standard tool adoption directly into patterns and platform components. Then when developers consume those patterns, they get governance and maintainability "for free."
