We wrote The Gruntwork Way for anyone trying to balance velocity, governance, and maintainability in their quest to better deliver software.

## Roles

In practice, we expect users in these roles will find this useful:

- **Platform engineers** building or improving their developer platforms
- **DevOps engineers** looking for best practices and patterns
- **Engineering leaders** evaluating their developer platform and/or cloud strategy

## Maturity levels

As you build your developer platform, you will go through a series of maturity stages. 

Actually, to be more precise, you will build maturity separately in your [patterns](/docs/way/platform/patterns/overview), [platform components](/docs/way/platform/components/overview), and [interfaces](/docs/way/platform/interfaces/overview). Your collective maturity level for the "developer platform" is really just the collection of maturity levels for its component parts.

In general, the component parts track these maturity levels:

- **Ad hoc** - There is no standard, so your team does things manually with minimal automation.
- **Building** - You've built something, but it's limited.
- **Established** - This component does add value, but with lots of room for improvement.
- **Mature** - This component performs its functions comprehensively and effectively.
- **Self-improving** - This component has a systematic feedback loop that leads to ongoing improvements.

The Gruntwork Way is especially useful for organizations with many building blocks in the **ad hoc,** **building,** or **established** stages.

Let's close out the introduction by giving you some pointers on how to use this framework!
