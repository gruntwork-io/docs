# Hello world

In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the process of setting up Gruntwork Pipelines for a single AWS account. This is useful both as a "hello world" for Gruntwork Pipelines and as the first step to getting it ready for production.

## What you'll get

By the end, you’ll have:

- An automated pipeline for deploying infrastructure changes into an AWS account
- Two GitHub repositories
  - `infrastructure-live` — Defines the infrastructure that is deployed to your AWS account
  - `infrastructure-pipelines` — Contains deployment definitions for your infrastructure
- A group of IAM roles in your AWS account that allow GitHub Actions modify your account through OIDC
- An S3 Bucket deployed automatically by Gruntwork Pipelines

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Permissions to create and administer repositories in GitHub
- A sandbox or development AWS account
- Valid [AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) for a user with AdministratorAccess to the AWS account mentioned above. Use [version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) of the *AWS CLI* if that's your preferred method of authentication.
- [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) installed on your system
- A GitHub user with an active **Gruntwork Subscription** for creating a [classic GitHub PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#personal-access-tokens-classic) with `repo` & `workflow` scopes as well as access to Gruntwork packages
  :::info
  To create a classic GitHub PAT:
    1. Navigate to https://github.com/settings/tokens
    1. Choose `Generate new token (classic)`.
    1. In the "Note" field, enter "Gruntwork Pipelines POC" (or something similar), select the `repo` and `workflow` scope checkboxes, then click `Generate token`.

  **Keep your token handy; we'll be using it shortly.**
  :::

## Setting up the repositories

In this section, you’ll set up two git repositories:

- The `infrastructure-live` repository will contain the definitions of your infrastructure as code (IaC)
- The `infrastructure-pipelines` repository will define how your IaC will be deployed.

Then, you’ll create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) that allows:

- GitHub Actions (GHA) workflows defined in `infrastructure-live` to run GHA workflows defined in `infrastructure-pipelines`
- GHA workflows defined in `infrastructure-pipelines` to clone the `infrastructure-live` repository

Finally, you’ll set up your PAT as a GitHub Actions secret in each repository.

### Create the repositories

Create a new repository from the templates provided below:

1. [gruntwork-infra-live-standalone-template](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-infra-live-standalone-template)
1. [gruntwork-pipelines-standalone-template](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-pipelines-standalone-template)

:::warning
In this tutorial, we will use the default GitHub repo configuration.

In a production environment, we recommend setting up
[branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule)
for your `main` branch as described in [Branch Protection](../security/branch-protection.md#recommended-settings).
:::

For each of the template repositories above:

1. Click `Use this template`
1. Click `Create a new repository`
1. Select your preferred organization from the owner dropdown
1. Name the repo anything you like and make note of the name.
1. Select the `Private` radio button
1. Click `Create Repository`
1. Repeat for the second template repository

### Setting up secrets

In this section, you're going to configure GitHub Actions secrets for each repository. Our goal here is to enable:

- `infrastructure-live` to kick off GitHub Actions workflows in the `infrastructure-pipeline` repository
- `infrastructure-pipelines` to clone the `infrastructure-live` repository
- `infrastructure-pipelines` to access Gruntwork modules

:::warning
In this tutorial, we will use a single GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with broad access in secrets.

In a production environment, we recommend using a mix of fine-grained and classic PATs as described in [Machine Users](../security/machine-users.md).
:::

The required secrets can be created using either the GitHub CLI or manually in the GitHub UI.

<details>
<summary>GitHub CLI</summary>

Copy the script below and **edit the exports at the top** to match your git repo names and GitHub PAT, then run it while authenticated using the [**GitHub CLI**](https://cli.github.com/)

```bash
export GHA_TOKEN=<YOUR_GITHUB_PAT> # This is the GitHub PAT you created in the prerequisites section
export INFRA_LIVE_REPO_NAME=<YOUR_REPO_HERE>
export INFRA_PIPELINES_REPO_NAME=<YOUR_REPO_HERE>

# infrastructure-live secrets
gh secret set INFRA_LIVE_ACCESS_TOKEN -a actions --repo $INFRA_LIVE_REPO_NAME -b $GHA_TOKEN;
gh secret set GRUNTWORK_CODE_ACCESS_TOKEN -a actions --repo $INFRA_LIVE_REPO_NAME -b $GHA_TOKEN;
gh secret set PIPELINES_DISPATCH_TOKEN -a actions --repo $INFRA_LIVE_REPO_NAME -b $GHA_TOKEN;

# infrastructure-pipelines secrets
gh secret set INFRA_LIVE_ACCESS_TOKEN -a actions --repo $INFRA_PIPELINES_REPO_NAME -b $GHA_TOKEN;
gh secret set GRUNTWORK_CODE_ACCESS_TOKEN -a actions --repo $INFRA_PIPELINES_REPO_NAME -b $GHA_TOKEN;
gh secret set PIPELINES_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN -a actions --repo $INFRA_PIPELINES_REPO_NAME -b $GHA_TOKEN;
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>GitHub UI</summary>

First, navigate to the `infrastructure-live` repository. Select the `Settings` tab, select the `Secrets and variables` drop down on the left side panel, then select `Actions`. Create the following secrets and use your GitHub PAT(created earlier in the the prerequisites section) as the value for all of them:

- `INFRA_LIVE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `GRUNTWORK_CODE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `PIPELINES_DISPATCH_TOKEN`

Next, navigate to the `infrastructure-pipelines` repository. Select the `Settings` tab, select the `Secrets and variables` drop down on the left side panel, then select `Actions`. Create the following secrets and use your GitHub PAT(created earlier in the the prerequisites section) as the value for all of them:

- `INFRA_LIVE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `GRUNTWORK_CODE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `PIPELINES_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`

</details>


## Generating code

In this section, you’ll generate the IaC and GitHub Actions workflow code required to run Gruntwork Pipelines using the `bootstrap.yml` workflow
included in your repository when it was generated with the Gruntwork template repository.


### Infrastructure-pipelines

1. Navigate to `Actions`
1. Click `Infrastructure Pipelines Bootstrap` in the sidebar on the left
1. Select the `Run Workflow` dropdown and enter the name of your `infrastructure-live` repository.
   ![Infrastructure-pipelines Workflow Form](/img/pipelines/tutorial/pipelines_run_workflow.png)
1. Click `Run Workflow` to start the workflow.
1. A Pull Request(PR) will be created after the workflow completes.
1. Review the changes, follow the instructions in the PR and then merge.

### Infrastructure-live

1. Navigate to `Actions`
1. Click `Infrastructure Live Bootstrap` in the sidebar on the left
1. Select the `Run Workflow` dropdown and enter the requested details.
   ![Infrastructure-live Workflow Form](/img/pipelines/tutorial/infra_live_workflow.png)
1. Click `Run Workflow` to start the workflow.
1. A Pull Request(PR) will be created after the workflow completes.
1. Review the changes, follow the instructions in the PR and then merge.

## Running your first pipeline

In this section, you’ll create a resource in your AWS account using Pipelines and GitOps workflows by defining a `terragrunt.hcl` file that creates an AWS S3 bucket in your AWS account, pushing your changes and creating a Pull Request (PR) to run a `plan` action, then run an `apply` action to create the bucket by merging your PR.

### Adding a new S3 bucket

First, create the folder structure that will contain the new S3 bucket in your environment. Replace `<account name>` with the value you used for `AwsAccountName` when generating your `infrastructure-live` code in the [infrastructure live](#infrastructure-live) section.

```bash
mkdir -p <account name>/<region>/<account name>/data-storage/s3
touch <account name>/<region>/region.hcl
touch <account name>/<region>/<account name>/data-storage/s3/terragrunt.hcl
```

Add the following content to the `region.hcl` file created above, replacing `<your region>` with the region you would like to deploy infrastructure in.

```hcl title="<account name>/<region>/region.hcl"
locals {
  aws_region = "<your region>"
}
```

Next, add the terragrunt code to create an S3 bucket. Copy the terragrunt code below, replacing `<your S3 bucket name>` with your desired bucket name. You may name the bucket whatever you like, just make sure it’s unique.


```hcl title="<account name>/<region>/<account name>/data-storage/s3/terragrunt.hcl"
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DEPLOY GRUNTWORK’s S3-BUCKET MODULE
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

terraform {
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog.git//modules/data-stores/s3-bucket?ref=v0.104.15"
}

include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

inputs = {
  primary_bucket = "<your S3 bucket name>"
}
```

### Planning and Applying

Create a new branch for your changes, commit your changes to your branch, then push your branch. Next, create a PR to merge your branch into `main` (the default branch in your repository). Follow this GitHub tutorial to [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) using your preferred tool of choice.

After you create the PR, GitHub Actions (GHA) will automatically run the GHA workflow defined in `infrastructure-live` in `/.github/workflows/pipelines.yml`. Once complete, Pipelines will add a comment to the PR with a link to the GHA workflow logs, click the link see the output of the `terragrunt plan` action that ran as a result of your changes.

If the `plan` output looks as expected, you are ready to merge your PR and create the S3 bucket. Click the `Merge pull request` button to merge the pull request. On merge, Pipelines will automatically run an `apply` action to provision the S3 bucket. You can find the GHA workflow run associated with the merged PR by navigating to the `main` branch on your PR and clicking on the Check Run icon at the top of the file explorer, then clicking `details` next to the Pipelines workflow. This will take you to the `dispatch` job for Pipelines, which contains a link to the workflow run in `infrastructure-pipelines` where you can see the output of your Pipelines run.

Congratulations! You've just used Gruntwork Pipelines and a GitOps workflow to provision resources in AWS.

## Common errors

### Error: Parameter token or opts.auth is required

This means that one of the secrets you needed to specify above was not configured correctly.

## Next steps

### Add/update/destroy more resources

At this point, you can continue using Pipelines on your own by adding, updating, and deleting `terragrunt.hcl` files to or from your environment. Alternatively, create a `_module_defaults` directory as a way to [set default module vaules](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/tree/master/_envcommon) picked up by multiple `terragrunt.hcl` files, define a module there, then use it in your environment to see how Pipelines handles these types of changes.

### Adding more AWS accounts

You also can extend your usage across many AWS accounts by re-running the `infrastructure-live` boilerplate template to create the folder structure for additional accounts (you will need to manually update your `accounts.yml` file with this approach).

### Adding more git repositories

You can extend the Pipelines model so that a single `infrastructure-pipelines` repository can serve more than one `infrastructure-live` repository. This is useful if a central DevOps team or platform team wants to maintain control over the Pipeline, while allowing individual app teams to "hook in" to the Pipeline.

## Cleanup (optional)

If you are not going to continue using Pipelines after this tutorial, clean up the resources you created by running `terragrunt run-all destroy` from your account based folder. You may also delete the two repositories created in [Setting up the repositories](#setting-up-the-repositories).
