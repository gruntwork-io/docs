# How it works

<!-- Placeholder for future content for Pipelines v2 -->

## Usage Data

Gruntwork Pipelines captures usage data to better understand how our customers use our products. This information includes the duration of pipelines runs, the number of jobs you run, customer name, and application errors that occur during execution. If you would like to disable telemetry, please set the environment variable `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` in your CI job.
