# Using Pipelines

Gruntwork Pipelines is designed to be used with a PR based workflow.
This means an approval on a PR is an approval to deploy infrastructure, making the configuration of repo settings and branch protection especially important.

## Recommended Settings

By default, Gruntwork pipelines runs a plan on every push to a PR and an apply on every push to `main`.
Branch protection should be enabled on `main` to prevent changes from being applied without approval.

- **Require a pull request before merging** should be enabled.
- **Require approvals** should be enabled. Optionally, more than one approval could be required.
- **Require review from Code Owners** should be enabled if you need control over which users are required to review specific code areas. See the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) for more information.
- **Require status checks to pass before merging** should be enabled.
  :::info
    This prevents `apply` from running when `plan` fails and ensures any validation rules your organization has put in place have been run.
  :::
- **Require branches to be up to date before merging** should be enabled with the `Pipelines` workflow selected as required.
  :::info
    This option prevents `apply` from running with an inaccurate `plan`, but has a tradeoff of increased GitHub Actions minute usage.
    When the PR is not up to date you will see the following message:
    ![Recommended Branch Protection Settings](/img/pipelines/pr-sync.png)
    With this option disabled, another PR could be merged into `main` after this PR has run `plan`. No new plan would be run
    in that scenario, so the `apply` has a higher likelihood of failure. If this risk is acceptable to your organization you may
    choose to ignore this recommendation.
  :::

The following is an example of the recommended settings for branch protection:

:::info
  You may wish to enable **Do not allow bypassing the above settings** to prevent admins from bypassing the branch
  protection rules. This will limit your options for applying emergency fixes, but is more secure.

## PR Workflow

1. Developers make infrastructure changes on a branch and create a PR against `main`
1. On PR creation, Gruntwork Pipelines runs `plan` on any changes and posts the results as a comment
1. Gruntwork Pipelines re-runs `plan` on every push to the branch and posts results as a comment
1. Approvals are gathered. If codeowners is enabled, the owner of each changed folder/file must approve the PR before it can be merged
1. Once approved, the PR is merged into `main`
1. Gruntwork Pipelines runs `apply` on any changes from the PR
   - On Success, a comment is placed on the PR indicating success
   - On Failure, a new GitHub issue is created describing the failure. A new PR must be created to resolve any failures.

## Allowing Pipelines Actions in GitHub Actions

Gruntwork Pipelines uses a set of Gruntwork built re-usable Github Actions, which are available in the GitHub Actions marketplace. Gruntwork is a Verified Creator of GitHub Actions.

### GitHub Enterprise

Gruntwork recommends explicitly allowing Actions required by Gruntwork Pipelines to run in your GitHub organization. See [Allowing select actions and reusable workflows to run](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-actions-in-your-enterprise#allowing-select-actions-and-reusable-workflows-to-run) to learn more.

You will need to allow the following GitHub Actions for Gruntwork Pipelines to run successfully:
- [gruntwork-io/pipelines-dispatch](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pipelines-dispatch)
- [gruntwork-io/pipelines-orchestrate](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pipelines-orchestrate)
- [gruntwork-io/pipelines-execute](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pipelines-execute)
- [gruntwork-io/terragrunt-action](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-action)
- [aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials)
- [Codex-/return-dispatch](https://github.com/Codex-/return-dispatch)
- [Codex-/await-remote-run](https://github.com/Codex-/await-remote-run)
- [dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset](https://github.com/dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset)
- [peter-evans/create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request)

Gruntwork recommends using a tagged version of the `gruntwork-io` actions and a wildcard for the non-Gruntwork actions, as the non-Gruntwork actions are wrapped in the Gruntwork actions. This will require less administrative work to keep policies up to date with versions being used by Gruntwork actions. An example policy can be found below.

```txt
gruntwork-io/pipelines-dispatch@<newest release>,
gruntwork-io/pipelines-orchestrate@<newest release>,
gruntwork-io/pipelines-execute@<newest release>,
gruntwork-io/terragrunt-action@<newest release>,
aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@*,
Codex-/return-dispatch@*,
Codex-/await-remote-run@*,
dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset@*,
peter-evans/create-pull-request@*
```

Navigate to each Gruntwork repository to retrieve the latest tagged release for each action.

### GitHub Team and Pro

Currently GitHub Actions does not support selecting specific repos outside of your own GitHub organization for the team and pro tier. To use Gruntwork Pipelines you must select the **Allow all actions and reusable workflows** option in the Actions general settings at the Organization level.
