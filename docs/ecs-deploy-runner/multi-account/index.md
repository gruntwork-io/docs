# Deploying Multi-Account Pipelines

Have you heard about AWS multi-account setups? It's like having a pack of dogs - each one with its own unique personality, strengths, and weaknesses, but all working together to accomplish a common goal.

Imagine you have a pack of dogs, each with their own special skills. You've got a fierce protector who guards the house, a speedy runner who chases down anything that moves, and a snuggly lap dog who just wants to cuddle all day. Each dog has its own needs, but they all rely on you as their owner to provide for them and keep them safe.

Similarly, with AWS multi-account setups, you can have a whole pack of accounts, each with its own unique configuration and requirements, but all managed from a single "parent" account. It's like being the alpha dog of a pack, making sure each member is fed, healthy, and happy.

And just like with a pack of dogs, there are different roles and responsibilities within an AWS multi-account setup. You've got the "owner" account, which is responsible for managing all the other accounts in the pack, and then you've got the "member" accounts, each with their own specific purposes and functions.

It's important to keep all your accounts organized and working together smoothly, just like how you would keep your pack of dogs in line. You don't want one dog to get too aggressive and start fighting with the others, just like you don't want one AWS account to start interfering with the others.

But if you can manage your pack of dogs successfully, they can work together to accomplish great things - just like how an AWS multi-account setup can help you achieve your goals with ease and efficiency. So, if you're a dog lover like me, you'll find that AWS multi-account setups are just as fun and rewarding as having a pack of loyal furry friends by your side. Woof!
