# Gruntwork Production Framework

At Gruntwork, we've had the privilege to work with everything from tiny startups to massive Fortune
50 companies to some of the world's largest government agencies, and along the way, we've seen the patterns that worked
and those that didn't. We took the patterns that worked and assembled them into the Gruntwork Production Framework,
an opinionated, step-by-step framework for successfully going to production on the public cloud.

At a high level, the framework consists of a handful of key ingredients you need to put in place to effectively use the
cloud:

If you'd like to build your mental model on how to think about cloud usage, and you're looking for a set of steps you
can follow to make better use of the cloud at your company, read the [Gruntwork Production Framework
Guide](/docs/guides/production-framework) for the full details.
