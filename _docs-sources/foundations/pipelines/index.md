# Pipelines for Account Factory

**Gruntwork Pipelines is a framework for securely and responsibly rolling out infrastructure changes to your AWS environments using GitOps workflows.** We often refer to Gruntwork Pipelines as simply "Pipelines."

These docs cover how Gruntwork Pipelines works specifically in the context of other DevOps components. For a more general overview of Gruntwork Pipelines, see the [dedicated documentation](/pipelines/overview).

## Gruntwork Pipelines and Gruntwork Landing Zone

In addition to rolling out infrastructure changes, Gruntwork Pipelines can also manage requests to create new AWS accounts as part of [Gruntwork Landing Zone](../../foundations/landing-zone)
