# Architecture

The Grunty GitHub App is a GitHub App introduced to help reduce the burden of integrating Gruntwork products to GitHub resources. The app is designed to be lightweight and flexible, providing a simple way to get started with Gruntwork products.

## Overview

There are three major components to keep in mind when working with the Grunty GitHub App:

1. **GitHub App**: The Grunty GitHub App itself, which is installed in your GitHub organization.
2. **Grunty API**: The API that interacts with the GitHub API on behalf of the Grunty GitHub App.
3. **Clients**: Clients that interact with the Grunty API to perform operations on GitHub resources.

## GitHub App

The Grunty GitHub App is the principal that Gruntwork products will utilize to interact with GitHub resources. The app can either be installed on a per-repository basis or on an entire organization.

### Required Permissions

As of 2024/09/10, the Grunty GitHub App requests the following permissions:

- **Read access to Actions**: Allows the app to read GitHub Actions artifacts.
- **Write access to Administration**: Allows the app to create new repositories, and add teams as collaborators to repositories.
- **Write access to Contents**: Allows the app to read and write repository contents.
- **Write access to Issues**: Allows the app to create and edit issues.
- **Write access to Pull Requests**: Allows the app to create and edit pull requests.
- **Write access to Workflows**: Allows the app to create and edit GitHub Actions workflow files.

  <summary>Why does Grunty need these permissions?</summary>

  Grunty requests all of these permissions because it requires them for different operations. Unfortunately, the way GitHub apps work prevents us from requesting permissions on a more granular basis. Know that Grunty will scope down its permissions whenever possible to the minimum required for the operation at hand.

  The level of granularity available to customers when configuring the GitHub App installation is to either install the app on a per-repository basis or on an entire organization. Our recommendation is to install the app on the organization as a whole, as this will allow Grunty to do all it's meant to do. You should use your best judgement when deciding on this, however. If you are unsure, reach out to Gruntwork Support for guidance.

  ### Read access to Actions

  Grunty needs read access to `Actions` in order to read GitHub Actions workflow logs.

  These permissions are used when generating the dynamic Pull Request comment created when a run completes indicating the exact location in workflow run logs users need to focus their attention.

  ### Write access to Administration

  Grunty needs write access to `Administration` to create repositories.

  These permissions are used during the initial bootstrapping process when customers opt-in to additional repositories being created outside of the main `infrastructure-live-root` repository.

  This is especially important for DevOps Foundations Enterprise customers, as those customers benefit from the ability to have `infrastructure-live-root` repositories create new repositories and add designated GitHub teams as collaborators via Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This is a critical feature for Enterprise customers who want to be able to scale their infrastructure management across multiple teams with delegated responsibility for segments of their IaC Estate.

  ### Write access to Contents

  Grunty needs write access to `Contents` in order to propose changes to repository contents.

  Pipelines engages in code generation when vending new AWS accounts in Gruntwork Account Factory, and Grunty needs to be able to generate and commit Terragrunt configuration files to the repository to provision the resources that will be present in the new account.

  ### Write access to Issues

  Grunty needs write access to `Issues` in order to create issues for users when it detects a problem with infrastructure.

  This is a mechanism that Pipelines uses to signal to users that they need to take manual action to resolve an issue.

  ### Write access to Pull Requests

  Grunty needs write access to `Pull Requests` in order to create pull requests.

  This is done both to propose changes in response to an explicit workflow like initiating an Account Factory vend, and to propose changes in response to detected drift detection for Enterprise customers.

  ### Write access to Workflows

  Grunty needs write access to `Workflows` in order to create GitHub Actions workflow files when vending GitHub repositories.

  This is necessary for Enterprise account vending, as Enterprise customers have the option of vending new repositories as part of Gruntwork Account Factory vending, and the GitHub API would not allow creation of new repositories with `.github/workflows` files without these permissions.

  ### Write access to Members

  Grunty needs write access to `Members` in order to adjust the repositories that a given GitHub team has access to.

  When vending delegated repositories for Enterprise customers, Grunty needs to be able to add designated GitHub teams as a collaborators to new repositories being vended.

## Clients

The Grunty API is used by two major clients:

1. **Gruntwork Developer Portal**

   This is the entrypoint all Gruntwork customers will use to interact Gruntwork products.

   The Grunty API is used here for administration of access to relevant GitHub resources by the Grunty App. Customers can follow the installation flow in <https://app.gruntwork.io> to install the Grunty GitHub App in their GitHub organization, then automatically get redirected to the Gruntwork Developer Portal to link the installed GitHub app to their Gruntwork organization profile, and configure it.

2. **Gruntwork Pipelines**
