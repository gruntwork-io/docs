# Availability

The availability of the Grunty GitHub App is something Gruntwork will endeavor to maximize. Core to the design of the app is that day-to-day operations do not depend on the availability of the app, however.

Over time, this may change, but the as of initial release, any downtime of the Grunty GitHub App will not impact the ability of your team to manage infrastructure using Gruntwork products.

## App Only Features

The following features of the Grunty GitHub App will be unavailable during downtime:

- **GitHub App Linking**: In order to link a Grunty installation to app.gruntwork.io, the app must be available and operating correctly.
