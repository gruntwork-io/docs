# About IaC Foundations

The IaC Foundations component is focused on:

- Teaching you the considerations to think about when coming up with your foundational Terraform and Terragrunt patterns
- Giving you a fully configured set of git repositories with an initial folder structure

## IaC foundations considerations

When creating your initial Terraform and Terragrunt and infrastructure, there are a number of patterns you need to consider how to solve. These include:

- How to create the backend (e.g. S3 bucket) for storing Terraform state
- How to structure your folder hierarchy
- How to handle tagging and labels
- Whether to use branches per environment
- How to handle global variables
- How to handle module default values

## Initial setup

We provide 3 template repos to subscribers that implement best practices regarding the considerations above.

### Infrastructure Live Template

### Infrastructure Modules Template

### Infrastructure Pipelines Template
