# What is Gruntwork Pipelines?

**Gruntwork Pipelines is a framework for securely and responsibly rolling out infrastructure changes to your AWS environments using GitOps workflows.** We often refer to Gruntwork Pipelines as simply "Pipelines."

Gruntwork Pipelines features first-class support for Terragrunt, runs on top of GitHub Actions, and uses a Pull Request-centric workflow. This means that all information about a proposed infrastructure change is added as comments to the applicable Pull Request, and that you apply the infrastructure change by taking action in the Pull Request.

Gruntwork Pipelines runs as a binary and series of steps in GitHub Actions, determining what _actions_ need to be taken, in which _environments_, based on the [_infrastructure changes_](#infrastructure-change) that occurred.

## Common Terms

Gruntwork Pipelines uses specific terminology to describe code changes and operations that occur as a result of changes. This section will familiarize you with the terminology used throughout the Gruntwork Pipelines documentation.

### Infrastructure change

When you edit any infrastructure-as-code that needs to be "applied" to your cloud account (e.g. AWS or GCP), you are making an _infrastructure change_. We sometime call these an "infra-change" for short.

Infra-changes can involve updates to Terraform/OpenTofu or Terragrunt code, or any other type of file that represents a desired state of your infrastructure and that needs to be somehow applied. A classic example is changing some variables on an instance of a Terraform module. Gruntwork Pipelines assumes that infra-changes are committed via git, usually by first opening a Pull Request. When you open a Pull Request, you are essentially "proposing" an infra-change.

### Infrastructure change set

Sometimes users create a Pull Request that changes more than one file at a time. And sometimes a change to a single file affects how multiple other files will be "applied" to your live cloud account. For example, many users of Terragrunt use a pattern known as "envcommon" as a way to specify a default set of values for modules.

When more than one infra-change is made at a time, we call this an _infrastructure-change set._ We sometimes call this an "infra-change set" for short.

### Pipelines actions

When a user proposes to make an infra-change by opening a Pull Request, we want to take some kind of "action" in response to that proposed-change. For example, we may want to run a `terragrunt plan` and estimate the cost of applying this Terragrunt plan. We call these _pipelines actions._

Gruntwork is responsible for adding support for a growing library of Pipelines Actions and we will continue to add more over time.
