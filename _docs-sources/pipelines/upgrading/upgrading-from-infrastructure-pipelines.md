# Upgrading from `infrastructure-pipelines`

This migration guide is intended for those running the previous version of Gruntwork Pipelines, referred to as `infrastructure-pipelines`, who want to upgrade to the latest version of Gruntwork Pipelines. We will refer to the latest version of Gruntwork Pipelines simply as "Pipelines" in the rest of this document.

## What's New

To get an idea of what makes the most recent version of Pipelines different from the previous version, we recommend reading the [deprecation notice](../../infrastructure-pipelines/overview/deprecation.md). This notice provides a high-level overview of the changes and improvements made in the latest version of Pipelines.
