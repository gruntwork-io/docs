# Overview

The pages in this section contain the reference information for the Gruntwork
Service Catalog for AWS. The Service Catalog consists of a number of reusable,
customizable, battle-tested, production-grade infrastructure-as-code services
that you can use to deploy and manage your infrastructure, including Docker
orchestration, EC2 orchestration, load balancing, networking, databases, caches,
monitoring, alerting, CI/CD, secrets management, VPN, and much more. Under the
hood, these services are built using modules from the Gruntwork Infrastructure
as Code Library.

## Features

- Deploy production-grade infrastructure in minutes by using off-the-shelf,
  battle-tested services.
- Build on top of infrastructure code that has been proven in production at
  hundreds of companies and is commercially supported and maintained by
  Gruntwork.
- Each service exposes a number of input variables that give you deep control
  over its behavior: e.g., what VPCs and subnets to use, what to do for log
  aggregation, how to manage SSH and VPN access, how to manage secrets, and so
  on.
- Each service is defined as code, so you can customize the behavior even
  further by either extending or forking the module.
