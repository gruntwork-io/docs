# What is the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark?

The [CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/resources/?type=benchmark) are objective, consensus-driven
configuration guidelines developed by security experts to help organizations improve their security posture.
The AWS Foundations Benchmark is a set of configuration best practices for hardening AWS accounts to establish
a secure foundation for running workloads on AWS. It also provides ongoing monitoring to ensure that the
account remains secure.
