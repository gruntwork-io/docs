# CIS Controls

Each recommendation is also linked to a corresponding [CIS Control](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/). The
controls are distinct from the Benchmark. Theyâ€™re described by CIS as "a prioritized set of actions that collectively
form a defense-in-depth set of best practices that mitigate the most common attacks against systems and networks".
Organizations seeking to implement a comprehensive security program or framework can use the controls to measure their
progress and prioritize security efforts. The Foundations Benchmark is just one of several guidelines that can help
reach the bar set by the CIS Controls. Refer to the Benchmark document directly to view how the recommendations map to
controls.
