An overview of the core concepts you need to understand what a typical CI/CD pipeline entails for infrastructure code,
including a comparison with CI/CD for application code, a sample workflow, infrastructure to support CI/CD, and threat
models to consider to protect your infrastructure.

An overview of how to configure a secure, scalable, and robust CI/CD workflow that you can rely on for your
production application and infrastructure code. To get a sense of what production-grade means, check out
