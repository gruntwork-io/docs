# Achieve Compliance With the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark

:::info

This guide was last updated on 6th September 2021, and it covers CIS 1.4.0 Benchmark recommendations. We aim to keep
it up to date with our infrastructure-as-code modules with the latest CIS Benchmark that has been released.
If you need to access older versions, please [get in touch](/docs/guides/support) with us.

:::

## Overview

This is a complete guide to help you achieve compliance with the
[CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services/). By following this guide,
you can launch infrastructure that is compliant with the Benchmark recommendations, and you'll be set to retain a
compliant state over time because all of the infrastructure is defined as code. This guide targets version 1.4.0 of the Benchmark.

Previously, we supported versions 1.3.0 and 1.2.0 of the Benchmark. If you are looking to upgrade from an older version please follow these in order:

- To upgrade from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0, please follow [this upgrade guide](../../../stay-up-to-date/1-cis/1-how-to-update-to-cis-13/0-intro.md);
- To upgrade from v1.3.0 to v1.4.0, please follow [this upgrade guide](../../../stay-up-to-date/1-cis/0-how-to-update-to-cis-14/0-intro.md).
