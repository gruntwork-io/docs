# AWS account

To use AWS, you must create an AWS account. You do this by signing up at <https://aws.amazon.com>. Once you’ve created
an account, it will get a unique, 12-digit
_[AWS account ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html)_ (note: the account ID is
not in and of itself a secret, so it’s OK to share it with trusted 3rd parties, but you might not want to go so far as
to share it publicly on the Internet), and you will be logged into your new AWS account as the root user.
