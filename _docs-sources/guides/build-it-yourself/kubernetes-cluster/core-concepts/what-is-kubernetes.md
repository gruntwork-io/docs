#### Scheduling

Deploy containers across a cluster of servers, using the available resources (data centers, servers, CPU, memory,
ports, etc.) as efficiently as possible.

#### Deployments

Roll out updates to containers using a variety of deployment strategies, such as rolling deployment, blue-green
deployment, and canary deployment, and automatically roll back if thereâ€™s an error.

#### Auto healing

Monitor the health of your containers and servers and automatically replace unhealthy ones.

#### Auto scaling

Scale the number of containers and servers up or down in response to load.

#### Load balancing

Make your containers accessible to the outside world and distribute traffic across your containers.

#### Service discovery

Allow containers to find and communicate with each other over the network, automatically routing requests to the
proper destination.

#### Configuration and secrets

Provide containers with environment-specific configuration data and secrets.
