# Lock down the root user in the child accounts

Once you’re able to access the root user of each child account, you should follow the steps in [Lock down the root user](lock-down-the-root-user.md)
for each of those child accounts—including enabling MFA and deleting the root user’s access keys—and (almost) never use
those root users again.
