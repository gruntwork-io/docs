# How Gruntwork can help

At this point, you've now seen the Gruntwork Production Framework. It consists of six key ingredients that, if you put
them in place, will make your organization more successful in the cloud. You could build all of these ingredients from
scratch, but why reinvent the wheel?

At Gruntwork, we offer best-of-breed, off-the-shelf solutions for each of these six ingredients. These ingredients can
reduce the up-front work by 90%, saving your organization months or years. Moreover, we've been working on these
ingredients for many years, and hundreds of companies have used them to go to production, so what we offer will be
higher quality than anything you can build from scratch. Finally, we provide commercial maintenance and support for all
of these ingredients, so we can reduce the work to keep up-to-date with all the latest changes by 90% as well!

Here's an overview of each ingredient and the off-the-shelf solutions available at Gruntwork:
