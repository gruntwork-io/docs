# Application Catalog

Whereas a Service Catalog is a way to provide your team with off-the-shelf solutions for infrastructure, an Application
Catalog is a way to provide your team with off-the-shelf solutions for applications. By "applications," we mean apps
(server-side apps, client-side apps, mobile apps) your team might build using general purpose programming languages
(e.g., Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Swift) and frameworks (e.g., Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails, Django, Express, React).
Most companies that successfully use the cloud assemble an Application Catalog, which typically consists of libraries,
frameworks, and templates your team can use to create new apps.
