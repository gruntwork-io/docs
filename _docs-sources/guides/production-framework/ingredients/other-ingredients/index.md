# Other Ingredients

No framework or tutorial could possibly cover everything. So, in this section, you'll find a list of some of the
ingredients not covered by this framework, that you may want to research independently:

## Operations / SRE

You'll want to take some time to think through what sort of Operations or SRE team and processes you want to put in place, including thinking through topics such as playbooks, SLAs, SLOs, error budgets, on-call rotations, incident management, emergency response, and post-mortems.

## IT and internal systems

Most of this framework is focused on using the cloud to run user-facing software, but most businesses will also need to think through how to run many of their internal-facing (IT) systems, such as version control (e.g., GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab), CI systems (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab), identity management (e.g., AD, LDAP, Google, Okta), license tracking (e.g., Snyk, WhiteSource), and issue tracking (e.g., Jira, Asana, Trello).

## Policies & processes

You'll want to think to think through broadly what sorts of policies and processes you want to use at your company. Some examples: incident response policy; disaster recovery policy; security vulnerability reporting; using Agile processes such as Scrum or Kanban; software license usage policy; and so on.

## Optimization

Performance optimization, cost optimization, and capacity optimization ("rightsizing") are important topics just about every company should look into.
