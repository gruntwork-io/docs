From the [release
notes](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v1.0.0): "Terraform v1.0.0 intentionally has no significant changes compared to
Terraform v0.15.5. You can consider the v1.0 series as a direct continuation of
the v0.15 series; we do not intend to issue any further releases in the v0.15
series, because all of the v1.0 releases will be only minor updates to address
bugs."
