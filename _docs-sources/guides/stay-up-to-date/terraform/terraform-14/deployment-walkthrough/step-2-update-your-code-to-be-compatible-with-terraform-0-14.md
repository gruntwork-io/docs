# Step 2: update your code to be compatible with Terraform 0.14

You will have to update your own code (e.g., the code that lives in your `infrastructure-modules` repo) to be
compatible with Terraform 0.14 by following HashiCorpâ€™s [Terraform 0.14
Upgrade Guide](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-14.html).
