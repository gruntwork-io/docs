# Step 2: update your code to be compatible with Terraform 0.15

You will have to update your own code (e.g., the code that lives in your `infrastructure-modules` repo) to be
compatible with Terraform 0.15 by following HashiCorpâ€™s [Terraform 0.15
Upgrade Guide](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-15.html).
