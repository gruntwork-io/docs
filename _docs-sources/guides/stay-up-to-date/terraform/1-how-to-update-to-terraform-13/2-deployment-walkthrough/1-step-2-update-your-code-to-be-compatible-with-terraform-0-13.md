# Step 2: update your code to be compatible with Terraform 0.13

You will have to update your own code (e.g., the code that lives in your `infrastructure-modules` repo) to be
compatible with Terraform 0.13 by following HashiCorpâ€™s [Terraform 0.13
Upgrade Guide](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html).
