# What is Gruntwork Library?

Gruntwork Library (formerly known as the "Gruntwork IaC Library") is a collection of reusable infrastructure-as-code that enables you to deploy and manage infrastructure quickly and reliably. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and consistency in infrastructure deployments. We’ve taken the thousands of hours we spent building infrastructure on AWS and condensed all that experience and code into pre-built packages or modules.

## Modules

Modules are "infrastructure building blocks" authored by Gruntwork and written in Terraform. They capture a singular best-practice pattern for specific pieces of infrastructure and are designed to be both limited in scope and highly reusable. They typically represent one part of a use case you want to accomplish. For example, the `vpc-flow-logs` module does not create a VPC, it only adds the VPC Flow Logs functionality to an existing VPC. To learn more, refer to [What is a module?](./modules.md).

## Services

Service modules are opinionated combinations of the "building block" modules described above. They are designed to be used "off the shelf" with no need to assemble a collection of “building block” modules on your own. They typically represent a full use case. For example, the `vpc` service module deploys a VPC, VPC Flow Logs, and Network ACLs. If you agree with the opinions embedded in a service module, they’re the fastest way to deploy production-grade infrastructure. To learn more, check [What is a service module?](./services.md).

## Tools used in Library

The Gruntwork IaC Library has been created using the following tools:

1. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). The Library contains nearly 300 Terraform modules that cover a range of common use cases in AWS. All library modules can be used with vanilla [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/), or third-party Terraform pipeline tools such as [Terraform Cloud](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-terraform-cloud/) and [Terraform Enterprise](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/index.html).

1. [Packer](https://www.packer.io/). The Library defines _machine images_ (e.g., VM images) using Packer, where the main use case is building Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that run on EC2 instances whose configuration is all defined in code. Once you’ve built an AMI, you can use Terraform to deploy it into AWS.

1. [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/). All modules are functionally validated with automated tests written using Terratest.
